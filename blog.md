Hello there.

I&#8217;m Gaurav Singh. I live in Bangalore, India with my wife and with my other love, Computers what else? I am a self-proclaimed geek. My first PC was an Intel 80386 running Windows 3.1 and the earliest programming language I remember working with was BASIC.

Over the years, I have been testing and **automating** a lot of Web apps, API&#8217;s and Mobile Apps (Android/IOS) in different domains.

I consider myself a reasonably experienced tester and have spent a significant amount of time writing automation frameworks and utilities in Python and Java and now more recently in Kotlin.

My work and experience have made me quite _opinionated_ on how _testing should happen_ and I <span style="text-decoration:underline;">do not</span> believe a tester is a sole person responsible for Quality but rather in a whole team testing approach.

My general motto in life is to &#8220;_Have strong opinions weakly held&#8221;_ and thus healthy debate and discussion are **very** valuable to me. That is how we all grow and learn IMHO.

I also consider myself to be a reasonable person overall and am always keen to listen and understand all viewpoints for something under discussion before coming to my own conclusions.

## Why do you blog?

My reasons are mostly selfish. I needed a repository of solutions to common problems in test automation/programming and also a way to keep track of my journey through the world of Software engineering and testing.

This blog is a way for me to hold on to all these experiences and sort of leave a trail of breadcrumbs which I could go back and refer.

To me, testing is a wholistic field in itself with its own set of **nuances** and this blog is a way for me express it to the larger community. Hopefully, this is useful, relevant or interesting to other people as well.
