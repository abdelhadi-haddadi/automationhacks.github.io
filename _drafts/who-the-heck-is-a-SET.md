These days you hear a fairly common title been thrown around in the testing and test automation space

This is an individual known by the title SET or SDET

I just Wonder who is an SET really?

Are they developers or are they software testers? and who is an automation engineer?

Argghh &#8230;

So many titles and equivalent amount of confusion.

We know from common discussions that this placeholder is a person who can write code, can review others codes and is fairly technical in nature

What do we mean by technical?

Let's just say that this person has a very good understanding of the stack that he is working in whether it be a web app mobile app for a backend system.

The primary expectation from an SET is to be able to write concise, well maintainable and scalable test automation frameworks obviously for the domain that he wants to contribute towards

So what could be some of the skills that a person with this placeholder should possess?

should be able to write clean code

understands refactoring design patterns and when to apply them

understands what are sensible practices while writing test automation code and adds these in the frameworks that he creates for the problem that you want to solve

Think deeply about an apps flows and can come up with a testing and automation strategy on how to test it effectively

understands the nuts and bolts of the product and has relevant context about the application that he owns

acts as a user advocate and always questions whether we are building the product right or we are building the right product this construct also is known as verification and validation

participates in writing of product spec along with business person and is able to provide insights and opinions on how to build a feature that would be beneficial for the end customer

keep in mind the use of telemetry and user data to validate if the product meets its goals when used by a consumer

belts analytics and reporting for the test automation framework and uses it to analyse any failures and maintains the test code

rights framework that is easy to follow and encourages developers to participate in writing that

advertisement for junior people on the team and shares his knowledge and tips and tricks with them

understands that there is no one correct way of doing something and has the perspective and the thought process to make sensible choices
