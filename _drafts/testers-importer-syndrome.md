Hi friend,

Being a tester/automation engineer, have you come across occasions where you feel like you **don't
know enough about something** and that people are going to catch you in your acts of ignorance or
find out that you are a fake or an imposter?

Turns out that you are not alone my friend. This is a very common phenomenon faced by humans in
different industries and is named **Imposter Syndrome**

## When does this happen

As a tester, you are _"supposed"_ to be the product expect no?. You should be knowing the in's and
out's of the system and should be able to explain what everything in the system does instantly
right? There are few flaws with these unrealistic expectation

- The app/service is almost **never** going to be constant and will keep on evolving with every new
  feature request that comes in
- It's impossible to keep track of every change in the system that might alter your understanding of
  the system
- In a team, multiple people might test different parts of the system and thus leading to no one
  person knowing everything about the system
- Unless you are the one who is developing the code, its difficult to understand each code path that
  can be taken in the flow and all its flaws

This can lead to testers feeling like an imposter in many cases wherein they might not really know
everything about the system that they test.

Or how about as an automation engineer, aren't you supposed to be the automation expert that can
well, **automate anything**, It seems like almost every few months a new tool/library comes out with
its own set of idiosyncrasies.

This put's even the pressures of dev domain, wherein you are in the race to understand programming
languages/tooling etc and design pattern to create scalable frameworks and even understand the
internals of the application you are testing

Product managers/engineering leads might expect you to have a clear idea of how something will be
tested/automated and how long would it take? This is on top of having to maintain an existing
automation framework/tests/infra

Wow, so much pressure right? It's impossible to be able to catch up with all of these internal and
external expectations at the same time and quite natural to feel like you don't know anything.

## How to deal with it

You have to first understand you are a human and while engineers typically want to think that we are
smartest person in the room, as it turns out in most situations, that's not the case. Understanding
and being mindful of your limitations is a good first step towards reducing some of these
expectations

### It's okay to say that you don't know

Don't put the unnecessary pressure of always being the **expert**, instead be open about when you
don't know something about the system or a new tool/framework. Treat these as opportunities to learn
and explore the system

It's okay to say that **X** is something you are not familiar with, **at the moment** but will learn
about, and then make absolutely goddamn sure that you follow up.

> Action speaks much louder than words

Done enough no of times, you are going to start finding out different pieces of the puzzle, make
sure you document these aggressively in either your projects WIKI or your own notes.

I can't tell you how many times i've had to revisit my own notes about a system or feature to
recollect stuff. Having a system like that to support you is very important. Our brains are not
designed to store stuff but rather to think creatively about problems and thus building a second
brain is something that's very important

### A Team is always > 1 person

You have to realize that there is a reason humans **work better in teams** than **individually**. A
team is a possibility to learn so many different things from others and probably one of the best
leverages you have against imposter syndrome

You have to ensure that there is a healthy culture within the team wherein everyone feels
comfortable in saying **I don't know** to their leaders/managers and people can voice out their
thoughts/concerns in a safe environment

You should learn to work well with others and delegate stuff to others if they are better suited for
the job but ensure you learn from them so that you are not bottlenecked on someone else. This way a
team stands on the shoulders of each other and is able to grow while still ensuring no one
individual feels the terrible imposter syndrome

### Learn constantly

If you are
