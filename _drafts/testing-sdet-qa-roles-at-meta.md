# Does Meta have Testing or SDET or QA openings?

I've been asked this question so many times that I feel this deserves a write up

So here are some thoughts around this, hoping this helps future visitors with
some context.

Some similar questions along the same lines:

- I can't find any QA/SDET/Testing openings on
  [Meta careers](https://www.metacareers.com/), can you help me find them?
- I see you have an SDET/Automation/Testing background, how did you get your
  current role?

I can understand how this is confusing for engineers with experience in other
companies of different sizes. I've been through the same journey

From what i've observed, as of writing this I'm close to completing my first 6 months in the company so please take this with a grain of salt. 

Meta for the most part does not have well defined SDET or QA role. There are people
with Software engineer titles who work on testing frameworks, infra, and such
though, in my case, I got introduced to the hiring manager through a friend who
was already working in Meta and the role seemed like a fit.

There are some roles like "QA Engineering lead" which are mostly QA leadership
roles here and some minor openings in the US with SDET. For instance, I found
this: https://www.metacareers.com/v2/jobs/1047737622456610/
