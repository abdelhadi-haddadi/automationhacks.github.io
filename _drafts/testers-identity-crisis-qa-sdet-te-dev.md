## Background

In the vast field of Software engineering, there are few broad disciplines that engineers typically
work under, which defines their primary identity on a cross functional team

Some of these disciplines are that of a Product manager (PM), Frontend developer
(Web/mobile/Desktop), Backend developer, Tester, Designer, Copywriter etc.

You can quite easily append **"Engineer"** to these roles to get a title.

The most common **developer** title that i've noticed is **"Software engineer" or SWE** for short
but it can be quite focussed on the specific stack/technologies that they work on, for instance some
of these titles are **Android engineer, iOS engineer, Backend engineer** etc, and these titles are
usually quite unambiguous. They roughly give a good sense of the role that the person will play on a
the team

**Test** discipline's titles is a different story all together, over a period of time we have come
up with innumerable different titles for something that's essentially the same and that confuses
more than they clarify.

Another common anti pattern with these titles is that HR/Orgs might decide to associate salary
ranges based on the title that a person possesses which may or may not really do justice to the
contributions or value an engineer on the team provides. However in the absence of strong
experienced leadership this is something unavoidable.

## Test disciplines titles confusion

There is a growing confusion about what the **Test** discipline calls itself, Some of the most
noticeable titles in the industry for a "tester" are **Test engineer** (TE), **Quality engineer**
(QE), **Quality Assurance engineer** (QAE), **Software development engineer in Test** (SDET ) or
more concisely **Software engineer in Test** (SET), or something like an **Automation engineer**
(AE), **Test automation engineer** (TAE), **Test Automation specialist**, **Test architect** (TA)

You obviously can prefix these with _Associate, Senior, Lead, Staff, Principal, Distinguished_ to
indicate a level of seniority in terms of experience or the role that the person plays on the team
but in IMHO people like to take these titles **way too seriously** for their own good.

It's very easy to become fixated on these and develop your entire personality around it. However, I
hope this post can convince you to take the more sane choice here

I wrote an earlier post sometime back on why I think [Titles for testers don't really
matter]({% link _posts/2020-02-29-the-problem-with-titles-for-testers.md%}) but for some reason this
question keeps on coming up time and again, and I sense many testers have similar thoughts so i hope
to provide some more clarity and share what I personally feel about this.

## Are they all the same

So, With all that background and context, At the end of the day, do you think all these are
equivalent?

> QA = QE = SDET = SET = TA?

The answer is dependent on multiple factors

- your company/orgs context
- What is the prior experience of the leadership team in your company regarding Test/Quality
  discipline
- You team members and how they have perceived other testers in their prior jobs

Different teams might associate different expectations of these titles

But, I've generally seen folks with these titles associating certain peculiar behaviors or
expectations (either by themselves or thrusted upon by others)

- **QA (Quality assurance)**: This is the most common title for a tester, This person is deemed to
  be (_often wrongly solely_) responsible for quality by testing the product and in most cases
  automating the process, sometimes this title is also wrongly assumed to say that the person does
  **only does manual testing**
- **QE (Quality engineer)**: Pretty much the same as above but shows a bit more thought behind to
  have a de-emphasis on the **"assurance"** word which has its own set of negative connotations (If
  X assures quality as a tester, Y as a developer can just throw everything over the wall to
  him/her?, By the way if you have face this i wrote about this unique bug ping pong phenomenon in
  an [earlier post]({% link \_posts/2019-06-24-testers-are-not-the-last-line-of-defence.md % }))
- **TE (Test engineer)** = Again similar to above
- **SDET/SET**: Now, we are in a fancy realm, We are now a software developer in Test, so folks with
  this title typically like to go ahead and only focus on **Developer tooling, Test automation**,
  **building frameworks, and rewriting them again and again ...**
- **AE (Automation engineer)**: pretty much the same as above
- **TA (Test architect)**: Folks having architect suffix indicate a higher level of seniority in
  terms of years of experience, This person usually designs solutions and the overall architecture
  and also gives high level framework specifications for other test engineers to implement, a person
  in this role may or may not be very hands on

## Which one to choose

Well, You can pretty much choose which ever you resonate with the most. However be **very careful**
to not build your whole persona around it, so much so that it becomes your sole identity

In general, I like to refer myself as a **tester** but regard myself more as a Software craftsman
and engineer first

I don't really like limit myself to just **testing activities**. I'm equally interested in all
phases of software development and really like coding, reading dev code/books/articles and have
authored multiple automation frameworks with different design patterns for different organizations.

Personally, I feel there is so much to learn and honestly the testing focus means that you can poke
and prod at the product in a whole different no of ways which you generally might not if you are
focussed on a specific discipline like Frontend or backend engineering.

The whole testing craft **really** excites me. Whether it be exploratory testing or designing
efficient automation. At the end of the day, whatever activities I do, My primary aim is the
accelerate the team and helps developers/team become faster and more confident in shipping code

While not sacrificing on quality and ensuring we put a well designed product in the hands of the
customer

So, Which of these titles really reflect the activities that I perform on a day to day basis?

If I had to choose one, I would pick **"Software engineer in Test"** as my preffered choice, since I
personally feel that gives a broad enough representation of what I do and resonates with me. Even a
more concise **"Test engineer"** works quite well.

I believe while we strive to be the voice of quality in the team and try and coach and nurture the
team towards a whole team quality culture, In the end, The customer is the best person to judge the
quality of your product
