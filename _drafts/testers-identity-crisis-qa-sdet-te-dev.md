In Software engineering, there are few broad disciplines that people work under and which defines
their primary identity as an engineer

For instance Product manager (PM), Frontend developer (Web/mobile/Desktop), Backend developer,
Tester, Designer, Copywriter etc. You can quite easily append "Engineer" to these roles to get a
title.

The most common developer title that i've noticed is **"Software engineer" or SWE** for short but it
can be very focussed on the specific stack/technologies that they work on, for instance Android
engineer, iOS engineer, Backend engineer etc, and these are quite unambiguous. The title roughly
gives a sense of the role that the person will play on the team

Test discipline is a different story all together, over a period of time we have come up with
innumerable different titles that just confuses more than they clarify. Another anti pattern that
emerges is that HR/Orgs might decide to associate salary brackets based on the title that a person
possesses which might not really be true in terms of the activities that someone performs

There is a growing confusion about what the **Test** discipline calls itself, Some of the most
noticeable titles in the industry for a "tester" are Test engineer (TE), Quality engineer (QE),
Quality Assurance engineer (QAE), SDET (Software development engineer in Test) or more concisely SET
(Software engineer in Test), or something like Automation engineer (AE), Test automation engineer
(TAE), Automation specialist, Test architect (TA)

You obviously can prefix Senior, Lead, Staff, Principal, Distinguished to indicate a level of
seniority in terms of experience or the expertise that the person plays on the team but in general
people take it way too seriously for their own good IMHO

I've written an earlier post on why I think [Titles don't really
matter]({% link _posts/2020-02-29-the-problem-with-titles-for-testers.md%}) but for some reason this
question keeps on coming up time and again, so i hope to provide some more clarity and what I
personally feel we should go with

So, At the end of the day, and regardless of what your team refers you based on their prior work
experience/context, are these all equivalent?

QA = QE = SDET = SET = TA?

Lets take a look at what people who have these titles generally think about these titles (Far
removed from reality in some cases, so please take this **sarcastic overtone** with a pinch of salt)

- QA (Quality assurance) = The person assures quality by testing the product and automating the
  process, sometimes this is wrongly assumed to even say that the person does **manual testing
  only**, HR: permission to give lower salary?
- QE (Quality engineer) = pretty much the same but a bit more general title with a de-emphasis on
  the "assurance" word which has its own set of negative connotations. (If X assures quality as a
  tester, Y as a developer can just throw everything over the wall to him/her?)
- TE (Test engineer) = again similar to above, Just replace quality with test.
- SDET/SET = Now, we are in a fancy realm, We are now a software developer in Test, so we would go
  ahead and only focus on Developer tooling, Test automation, building frameworks, rewriting them
  again and so on ..., HR: Okay since they code, we should give them higher salary?
- AE (Automation engineer) = pretty much the same as above
- TA (Test architect) = Since i have an architect suffix and probably a higher seniority in terms of
  years of experience, I must make elaborate designs and architecture diagrams and give high level
  framework specifications to other test engineers to implement, but not be hands on?

Do you see the commonality between these?
