Hi friend,

If you answered yes to the above question, I encourage you to think again.

From my own experience, I've found they can test and to be honest test quite well, almost to the
point where you (as the team's tester) can actually take a vacation and come back and it would still
be BAU (Business as usual) with awesome stuff getting shipped.

You might now be thinking, what is this guy talking about, this seems like wishful thinking and a
pipe dream at best.

But what if I were to tell you that there is a very simple thing you can do to ensure the team
collectively gets better at testing and testing becomes _fun_ to a certain degree.

_Waat?_ Devs enjoying testing? That's bullshit.

But hold on, don't move on to the next blog ðŸ›‘, enough with the tease.

One of the ways that i've discovered that works quite well in encouraging whole teams participation
in owning the quality of the product is a technique called as **mob testing**
