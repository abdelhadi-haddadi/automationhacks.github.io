Hello there.

I'm Gaurav Singh. I live in Bangalore, India with my wife and with my other love, Computers what
else? I am a self-proclaimed geek. My first PC was an Intel 80386 running Windows 3.1 and the
earliest programming language I remember working with was BASIC.

Over the years, I have been testing and **automating** a lot of Web apps, API's and Mobile Apps
(Android/IOS) in different domains.

I consider myself a reasonably experienced tester and have spent a significant amount of time
writing automation frameworks and utilities in Python and Java and now more recently in Kotlin.

My work and experience have made me quite _opinionated_ on how _testing should happen_ and I do
**NOT** believe a tester is a sole person responsible for Quality but rather in a whole team testing
approach.

My general motto in life is to _Have strong opinions weakly held_ and thus healthy debate and
discussion are **very** valuable to me. That is how we all grow and learn IMHO.

I also consider myself to be a reasonable person overall and am always keen to listen and understand
all viewpoints for something under discussion before coming to my own conclusions.

## Why do you blog

My reasons are mostly selfish. I needed a repository of solutions to common problems in test
automation/programming and also a way to keep track of my journey through the world of Software
engineering and testing.

This blog is a way for me to hold on to all these experiences and sort of leave a trail of
breadcrumbs which I could go back and refer.

To me, testing is a wholistic field in itself with its own set of **nuances** and this blog is a way
for me express it to the larger community. Hopefully, this is useful, relevant or interesting to
other people as well.
