## Sharing a good news! 🥳

Hello everyone 👋, As I start to write this long post, its been more than a
month that I took up my new job at **Meta London** 🇬🇧 as a **Software
Engineer**. This was a **really** big career decision for me and my family and
something I always wanted to try out and this post is to share more about this
process in the hopes that it would help others in the community in case they are
interested.

While preparing for these interviews I read through couple of excellent posts on
applying and preparing for Software engineering interviews at Big Tech companies
and this post in a way is inspired from these, Having got **"that"** job, this
post is my way of paying the advice forward.

I would recommend reading these excellent posts out when you have time:

- [Get that job at Google by Steve Yegge](http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2008/03/get-that-job-at-google.html)
- [Get that job at Facebook by Engineering @ Meta](https://www.facebook.com/notes/10158791572847200/)

### A word of gratitude

But before I begin, I would really like to start with a thought of gratitude 🙌
towards **all the people** who helped me in this long journey especially my wife
who was extremely patient as I spend long hours morning/night for months
preparing and couple of friends without which this would really have not have
been possible.

## The right mindset going into the process

As you start to read this post,

- You might be having multiple thoughts about the company, the interview process
  and whether you can even do it?
- You might be thinking, there are thousands of applicants for any particular
  position, Do I stand a chance?

I experienced most of these thoughts first hand and while some were motivating,
others not so much. And before you spiral further, let me stop you right there
and offer you a simple piece of advice.

> Slow down, Breathe. ☺️ Take your time and don't give up! You got this!

These interview loops are certainly not a piece of cake 🍰 and its very easy to
go down a rabbit hole and let this be the **only** thing that consumes
everything in your life. But please don't.

At the end of the day, while a job at one of the `#FAANG (now #MAANG)` companies
is really coveted and offers nice perks/salary and learning opportunity, it is a
job and might not be the right fit for you and should definitely not take
priority over your physical and mental wellbeing.

### A note about failure 🙅‍♂️

Its also really easy to take interview failures really hard and think you are
not good enough, and I've also been a subject to multiple of these rejections,
just realize this happens with everyone, sometimes you might be underprepared,
or might be having an off day or just get stuck and I think its only human for
this to happen.

> You must fail fast and fail better!

An interview is sort of like a mirror reflection of where you are in your
preparation journey and any failure does not mean you are not qualified but
simply not as prepared.

I've learned that the correct mindset to approaching these interviews is to have
that mental model that:

- You are going to speak with some really cool and intelligent people from world
  class companies
- figure out and collaborate on few interesting and challenging problems and
  just take your best swing at it for 45-60 mins
- And no matter the outcome, you'll walk away with something interesting that
  you learn either about your own preparation levels, any gaps you need to fill
  and get better at, learn more about the company culture and work
- And in some cases, maybe the final offer as well. 😉

I heard
[Gergely Orosz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gergelyorosz/?originalSubdomain=nl)
talk about this and many other prep tips in his YouTube Video
[Confessions from a Big Tech Hiring Manager: Tips for Software Engineering Interviews](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFOw_m5zNCs)
and I must say I agree that this is the **helpful** mindset people should
approach these interviews.

## The Interview process

If you are still here after that word of advice 💪, I think you are ready for
this sea of information with lots of links to resources that helped me, so let
me get right to the point 👇

Meta (previously known as facebook) as of 2021 has the below interview loop for
Software Engineers position.

> Note: There are different roles within the company, Product engineer, Quality
> specialist, QA Engineering lead, Android/iOS/Backend dev/AI/ML engineers and
> so on, please check with your recruiter as some of these rounds could have
> different scope and objectives and they are in the best position to confirm.

- Recruiter screening
- 1 Coding interview (screening)

Followed by a full onsite interview loop having total of 4 interviews of 45 mins
each.

- 2 Coding interview
- 1 System design interview
- 1 Behavioral interview

See below sections for resources as well as tips on how to prepare for each of
these

## Getting shortlisted

### Writing an effective resume

The first step to any interview journey is to write a good resume that helps
make your case in front of the recruiter and hiring manager. In most cases
people will skim read it first so spending time and making your resume concise
but still the best reflection of your skills is very important.

Luckily there are many amazing resources out their with sage advice on how to
write effective resume.

Below are what I referenced heavily:

- [The Google resume by Gayle Laakmann mcdowell](https://www.amazon.co.uk/GOOGLE-RESUME-GAYLE-LAAKMANN-MCDOWELL/dp/8126538058/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=)
- [Tips on good resume by Gayle from cracking the coding interview](https://www.careercup.com/resume)

In general, writing a good resume is just like any other skill, you start with a
good enough version, iterate and keep refining it till it works quite well.

**Do's:** ✅

- Mention technical items that show you are smart and can code and the impact
  you've had in the teams that you've worked in
- Prefer writing a **1 page resume** (if you years of experience is < 10 years)
  and max 1.5 - 2 pages for more experienced candidates
- Add only the relevant positions that makes you an impressive candidate for the
  role
- Write strong bullet points that convey impact **Accomplished X by implementing
  Y which led to Z**, Show what you did, how you did and what were the results
- Projects - Please list only the relevant and recent projects, the resume does
  not have to be comprehensive work history but only bits that are relevant to
  the position you are applying for
- Programming languages and software
  - Softwares and Tools: List only that very specific keywords, eliminate
    others, remember anything you put on your resume is fair game during an
    interview.
  - Languages: List only the ones which you are comfortable with and not
    everything
    > Tip: 💡 You can add proficiency level around the language: Python
    > (expert), Kotlin (proficient), Java (fluent)
- > 🔺: Remember to **tailor** your resume to the role you are applying for,
  > i.e. ensure your resume has those aspects highlighted that the job
  > description focusses on (obviously while being authentic to your experiences
  > and skills). Many candidates don't do this and this is quite an underrated
  > activity but doing this could well mean the difference between a resume
  > reject vs getting that call from the recruiter.

**Don't** ⛔

- Don't include non tech hobbies as they don't matter much
- Adding no of years to a programming language is a poor metric, For instance,
  if you started working with a language 10 years ago but have used it only few
  times what is the no of years that you can claim?
- Do not add age, marital status, nationality as this sort of personal
  information can create a legal liability for US companies
- Remove lengthy certifications
- Knowing only one or two languages gives the impression that you haven't
  experienced many technical problems

## Research and apply

The next phase is to find the positions that you are interested in. With Covid,
the tech market become unusually hot and there was no shortage of roles for
skilled candidates.

There are multiple job search engines available, the most prominent being
**LinkedIn**, Indeed etc. You can setup job alerts for the companies, locations
and role that meet your profile and then research and applying to them.

> Tip: Once you find the opening you are interested in, Try to see if there is
> anyone in your network already working in the company and try to get a
> referral or introduction. Getting an employee referral puts your resume at the
> top of the priority list and has a high chance of being reviewed by the
> recruiter and the hiring manager. LinkedIn and Twitter are good spaces to
> build a network that you could leverage later on if needed.

If you looking for a structured process to research and apply to companies, I
found this video by Jeff H Sipe
on[How to Research a Company for a Job Interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXqznIrzh-s)
quite helpful, his YouTube channel also has excellent content on the interview
process backed by his multiple years of experience working as a recruiter in
Google.

> Reflection: In my case, I had my friend and colleague from a previous company
> who was already working in facebook and who forwarded my profile to the hiring
> manager for the role. Post speaking with the hiring manager, I was very
> excited by the role and the learning opportunity at hand and got the recruiter
> call shortly after. This experience validated the thought of putting extra
> effort in getting a referral if you can as it gives much better result

If you however don't know anyone at the company, go ahead and apply anyway. Some
companies do screen inbound resumes and I have also got few reach outs the same
way.

## The recruiter screening

Once the recruiter is interested in your profile, they would reach out to
schedule a discussion over phone or video conference (VC). These conversations
are to understand your profile a bit better and see if you are a fit.

As always being authentic to your experience and skills is important and your
honest answers would help the recruiter to understand how much prep time you
would need for the interview loop.

Meta recruiters were amazing in that they give sufficient time for you to
prepare well and share lot of guidance and prep materials. Contrary to some
other companies, the interview process is fairly open and transparent with clear
expectations laid out. This leaves very little room for ambiguity and is an
excellent candidate experience.

> Remember to ask lot of good questions about the role and the interview process
> and get clarity for your specific role. Its perfectly fine to clarify the
> scope of the interview rounds and what you can reasonably expect. Also, being
> kind and gracious throughout the conversation can go a long way since the
> recruiter is really on your side and its in their best interest to ensure you
> succeed.

## The Screening Coding interview

Meta has **3 rounds** of coding interviews. Your recruiter would usually
schedule an initial screening interview and depending on how well you do, it
would be followed by the full onsite interview loop having 2 more coding
interviews

Succeeding in these coding interviews is challenging for sure, but **definitely
doable**. Its a matter of practicing well, **consistently**. There are many
sites and resources out there that provide a lot of details on this phase of the
interview process and I would recommend checking these resources out or you can
see a list below this section that I found quite helpful.

These rounds focus on solving 2 algorithmic style problems focussed on **data
structures and algorithms, problem solving skills and communication and
collaboration skills** within a span of **40 minutes**, leaving 5 mins for
questions.

Contrary to some other companies, where there is some time for introductions,
your interviewer would very quickly introduce themselves and then jump into the
initial problem. What **area** or **skill** the problem would assess is
completely up to them and could be on any data structure or algorithm area in
the below list

### Data structures to know

- Array
- Stack
- Queue
- Map
- List
- Linked list
- Trees (Binary Tree, Binary Search Tree, Ternary, N-ary)
  - [Prefix tree or trie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-urNrIAQnNo)
- Graphs

### Algorithm

- DFS (Depth first search)
- BFS (Breadth first search)
- Recursion
- Two pointers
- Sorting
- Dynamic programming (rare, but sometimes asked)

### How to prepare for DS and algorithm questions

People with a computer science engineering background have mostly gone through
these Data structures and algorithms at least once, however while working
professionally, most people don't really remember these off the top of their
head

Depending on the amount of time you have for the interview its best to be very
clear about these different data structures and algorithms, conceptually and
then practice a lot of different problems while trying to use these to solve

I read through few books and sites to get that theoretical base around DS and
Algo,
[Cracking the coding interview](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Cracking-Coding-Interview-6th-Programming/dp/0984782850/),
[Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures using Python By Brad Miller and David Ranum, Luther College](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published//pythonds/index.html)
and [The Interview Cake Course](https://www.interviewcake.com/table-of-contents)
and there are many more resources mentioned in Gergely's blog as well
[Preparing for the Systems Design and Coding Interview by Gergely Orosz](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/preparing-for-the-systems-design-and-coding-interviews/)

Once done with these, I also went through sections on **Arrays, Binary Search,
Linked list, Recursion, Graphs, Binary Trees** on
[Leet code](https://leetcode.com/explore/) and then mostly solved Top 100
questions asked by Facebook. Getting the premium subscription meant I could
access the solutions to these problems

I found this to be very useful for this interview loop. There are other sites
like [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) that is also used by some
companies.

> Its important to solve different problem types rather than many problems of
> the same type since you should optimize for coverage than solid depth in one
> over the expense of others.

### Additional tips to keep in mind

- While practicing for coding rounds, ensure you **practice talking out loud**,
  this is very important skill to develop since if you hardly speak a word but
  still solve the problem it tells your interviewer very little signal about how
  good of a collaborator you are and this is something they look for.
- Try to **time yourself while solving these problems** and develop enough speed
  to solve the problems with optimal solution within 20 mins. Don't worry if you
  don't have the speed initially, as you solve more problems you'll start to
  recognize patterns that you could use and solve category of problems and
  you'll get faster.
- Practice daily, think of these problems as workout for your mind to ensure you
  don't get rusty. The more you practice, the more muscle memory you'll develop
  and the faster you would become.
- Please review solved problems every week (This is very important). Try and
  re-solve already solved problems since the forgetting curve is quite real. You
  can use a spaced repetition tool like Anki to even prompt same problems on a
  periodic basis
- Practicing these interviews with a buddy is amazing since they can give you
  actionable feedback for improvements, you could also leverage a community
  platform like [Pramp](https://www.pramp.com/#/) to do mock interviews. The
  more you do this, the better are your chances of success since you can share
  tips, and also for the much needed feedback
- Remember you should aim to solve the problem first even if its a naive
  solution, **done is better than perfect**. However don't stop as soon as you
  have the naive solution in place since you are expected to reach an optimal
  solution to the problem at hand if possible to get extra points.

## System design Interview

The system design interview is an interview round to assess how well do you
understand design and architecture of systems and given a vague problem, can you
clarify and design a high level system and then dive deep into few components.

You could be asked to design any system, there are mostly commonly talked about
systems like WhatsApp, DropBox/Google Drive, Instagram, Twitter, Type ahead
search, Search Engine, Web crawler or it could be a niche use case. Really
understanding all the concepts around system design is how you can excel in this
round

Depending on the role you are looking for the scope of this round can change
thus clarifying with your recruiter is very important. For e.g. for a product
engineer the focus might be more on how do you design the API and database
schema for the backend system whereas for an Infra engineer the focus could be
how well does the candidate consider different systems (Db, cache, load
balancing, security) and other concerns

### Expectations from system design round

Below are the expectations from this round and performance in this gives a very
good signal as to the target level of the candidate.

- You are expected to design and build a distributed system from scratch
- How well do you gather requirements and explore the problem first
- How well do you do quantitative analysis, work out the scale, size of data
  that you will be working with
- Do you consider tradeoffs for the design choices
- How well do you deep dive into components and details
- How do you reason how the data is stored, secured and structured
- Do you need too much prompting, can you lead the conversation

There are some excellent resources for preparing for system design and I'd
recommend any of these

## Resources for system design

### YouTube:

I personally referred to videos on multiple you tube channels (often even while
during house hold chores to really soak the different concepts)

  role?
- What do you like the best about your role and the company?

Hiring Manager:

- What do you like the best about your role and the company?
- What is the biggest challenge your team is facing this year, in the upcoming
  months, etc.?

  the next steps?
- Any additional information you would like from me?

Team Member:

- What do you like the best about your role and the company?
- What do you look for in a team member?
- How do you foster a collaborative team?
- How will hiring this position help you?
- What is a specific pain point you are facing now because this position is not
  hired?
- Does the team tend to work on projects together or alone?

Cross Functional:

- What do you like the best about your role and the company?
- How does your team interact with the team I would be supporting?
- How often would we be working together?

## Conclusion

As always, Do share this with your friends or colleagues and if you have
thoughts or feedback, I'd be more than happy to chat over at twitter or
comments. Until next time. Happy Testing and coding.
