## Sharing a good news! 🥳

Hello everyone 👋, As I start to write this long post, its been more than a
month that I took up my new job at Meta London 🇬🇧 as a Software Engineer. This
was a **really** big move for me and my family and something I always wanted to
try out and this post is to share more about this process in the hopes that it
would help others in the community in case they are interested.

But before I begin, I would really like to start with a thought of gratitude 🙌
towards **all the people** who helped me in this long journey especially my wife
who was extremely patient as I spend long hours morning/night for months
preparing and couple of friends without which this would really have not have
been possible.

## The right mindset

As you start to read this post,

- You might be having multiple thoughts about the company, the interview process
  and whether you can even do it?
- You might be thinking, there are thousands of applicants for any particular
  position, Do I stand a chance?

I experienced most of these thoughts first hand and while some were motivating,
others not so much. And before you spiral further, let me stop you right there
and offer you a simple piece of advice.

> Slow down, Breathe. ☺️ Take your time and don't give up! You got this!

These interview loops are certainly not a piece of cake 🍰 and its very easy to
go down a rabbit hole and let this be the **only** thing that consumes
everything in your life. But please don't.

At the end of the day, while a job at one of the `#FAANG (now #MAANG)` companies
is really coveted and offers nice perks/salary and learning opportunity, it is a
job and might not be the right fit for you and should definitely not take
priority over your physical and mental wellbeing.

### A note about failure

Its also really easy to take interview failures really hard and think you are
not good enough, and I've also been a subject to multiple of these rejections,
just realize this happens with everyone, sometimes you might be underprepared,
or might be having an off day or just get stuck and I think its only human for
this to happen.

> You must fail fast and fail better!

An interview is sort of like a mirror reflection of where you are in your
preparation journey and any failure does not mean you are not qualified but
simply not as prepared.

I've learned that the correct mindset to approaching these interviews is to have
that mental model that:

- You are going to speak with some really cool and intelligent people from world
  class companies
- figure out and collaborate on few interesting and challenging problems and
  just take your best swing at it for 45-60 mins
- And no matter the outcome, you'll walk away with something interesting that
  you learn either about your own preparation levels, any gaps you need to fill
  and get better at, learn more about the company culture and work
- And in some cases, maybe the final offer as well. 😉

I heard
[Gergely Orosz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gergelyorosz/?originalSubdomain=nl)
talk about this and many other prep tips in his YouTube Video
[Confessions from a Big Tech Hiring Manager: Tips for Software Engineering Interviews](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFOw_m5zNCs)
and I must say I agree that this is the **helpful** mindset people should
approach these interviews.

## The Interview process

If you are still here after that **"gyaan"** (loosely translated from Hindi to
**pep talk**) 💪, I think you are ready for this sea of information with lots of
links to resources that helped me, so let me get right to the point 👇

So Meta (previously known as facebook) as of 2021 has the below interview loop
for Software Engineers

- 1 Coding interview (screening)

Followed by a full onsite interview loop having total of 4 interviews of 45 mins
each.

- 2 Coding interview
- 1 System design interview
- 1 Behavioral interview

See below sections for resources as well as tips on how to prepare for each of
these

## Getting shortlisted

### Writing an effective resume

Before we get into the interview loop and prep, its important to get this
opportunity.

The first step to any interview journey is to write a good resume that helps
make your case in front of the recruiter and hiring manager.

[The Google resume by Gayle Laakmann mcdowell](https://www.amazon.co.uk/GOOGLE-RESUME-GAYLE-LAAKMANN-MCDOWELL/dp/8126538058/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=)
provides lot of insightful tips and mistakes to avoid

Here are some tips that i've gathered on writing a good resume

**Do's:** ✅

- Have technical items that show you are smart and can code
- Prefer writing a 1 page resume (if you years of experience is < 10 years),
  1.5 - 2 pages for more experienced candidates
- Add only the relevant positions that makes you an impressive candidate
- Writing strong bullet points - **Accomplished X by implementing Y which led to
  Z** **Show what you did, how you did and what were the results**
- Projects - Please list only the relevant and recent projects
- Programming languages and software
  - Software: List only that very specific keywords, eliminate others, remember
    anything you put on your resume is fair game during an interview.
  - Languages: List only the ones which you are comfortable with and not
    everything
    > Tip: 💡 You can add proficiency level around the language: Python
    > (expert), Kotlin (proficient), Java (fluent)

**Don't** ⛔

- Don't include non tech hobbies as they don't matter much
- Adding no of years to a language is a poor metric, if you started 10 years ago
  but have used it only few times what is the no of years that you can claim
- Do not add age, marital status, nationality as this sort of personal
  information can create a legal liability for US companies
- Remove lengthy certifications
- Knowing only one or two languages gives the impression that you haven't
  experienced many technical problems
