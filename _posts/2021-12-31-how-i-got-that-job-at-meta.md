## Sharing a good news! 🥳

Hello everyone 👋, As I start to write this long post, its been more than a
month that I took up my new job at Meta London 🇬🇧 as a Software Engineer. This
was a **really** big move for me and my family and something I always wanted to
try out and this post is to share more about this process in the hopes that it
would help others in the community in case they are interested.

But before I begin, I would really like to start with a thought of gratitude 🙌
towards **all the people** who helped me in this long journey especially my wife
who was extremely patient as I spend long hours morning/night for months
preparing and couple of friends without which this would really have not have
been possible.

## The right mindset

As you start to read this post,

- You might be having multiple thoughts about the company, the interview process
  and whether you can even do it?
- You might be thinking, there are thousands of applicants for any particular
  position, Do I stand a chance?

I experienced most of these thoughts first hand and while some were motivating,
others not so much. And before you spiral further, let me stop you right there
and offer you a simple piece of advice.

> Slow down, Breathe. ☺️ Take your time and don't give up! You got this!

These interview loops are certainly not a piece of cake 🍰 and its very easy to
go down a rabbit hole and let this be the **only** thing that consumes
everything in your life. But please don't.

At the end of the day, while a job at one of the `#FAANG (now #MAANG)` companies
is really coveted and offers nice perks/salary and learning oppurtunity, it is a
job and might not be the right fit for you and should definitely not take
priority over your physical and mental wellbeing.

### A note about failure

Its also really easy to take interview failures really hard and think you are
not good enough, and I've also been a subject to multiple of these rejections,
just realize this happens with everyone, sometimes you might be underprepared,
or might be having an off day or just get stuck and I think its only human for
this to happen.

> You must fail fast and fail better!

An interview is sort of like a mirror reflection of where you are in your
preparation journey and any failure does not mean you are not qualified but
simply not as prepared.

I've learned that the correct mindset to approaching these interviews is to have
that mental model that:

- You are going to speak with some really cool and intelligent people from world
  class companies
- figure out and collaborate on few interesting and challenging problems and
  just take your best swing at it for 45-60 mins
- And no matter the outcome, you'll walk away with something interesting that
  you learn either about your own preparation levels, any gaps you need to fill
  and get better at, learn more about the company culture and work
- And in some cases, maybe the final offer as well. 😉

I heard
[Gergely Orosz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gergelyorosz/?originalSubdomain=nl)
talk about this and many other prep tips in his YouTube Video
[Confessions from a Big Tech Hiring Manager: Tips for Software Engineering Interviews](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFOw_m5zNCs)
and I must say I agree that this is the **helpful** mindset people should
approach these interviews.

## The Interview process

If you are still here after that gyaan (loosely translated to **pep talk**) 💪,
I think you are ready for this sea of information, so Let me get right to the
point 👇

So Meta (previously known as facebook) as of 2021 has the below interview loop
for Software Engineers

- 1 Coding interview (screening)

Followed by a full onsite interview loop

- 2 Coding interview
- 1 System design interview
- 1 Behavioral interview



## Conclusion

As always, Do share this with your friends or colleagues and if you have
thoughts or feedback, I'd be more than happy to chat over at twitter or
comments. Until next time. Happy Testing and coding.
