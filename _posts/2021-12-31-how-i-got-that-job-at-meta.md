## Sharing some good news! 🥳

Hello everyone 👋,

As I start to write this long post, its been more than a month that I took up my
new job at **Meta London** as a **Software Engineer**.

This was a **really** big career move for me and my family and something I
always aspired to and working at that level of scale felt as the right step up
for us.

## Motivation for this post

After updating my profile in LinkedIn and other social media, some people and
engineers that I knew reached out to congratulate and also asked for advice on
how can they prepare better for similar roles at BigTech and other high growth
companies

This post is my humble attempt to share more about this process from my own
experience in the hopes that it would be valuable for the community

> ️⚠️ **Disclaimer**: Opinions in this post are purely my own based on my
> personal experience and not in any way representative of my employer. Please
> take these with a grain of salt.

While preparing for these interviews, I read through many excellent posts on
applying and preparing for **Software engineering interviews at Big Tech**
companies and this post's title is inspired from these, Having finally got
**"that"** job, this post is my way of paying the advice forward.

I would highly recommend reading these excellent posts when you have time:

- [Get that job at Google by Steve Yegge](http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2008/03/get-that-job-at-google.html)
- [Get that job at Facebook by Engineering @ Meta](https://www.facebook.com/notes/10158791572847200/)

### A word of gratitude 🙏🏼

Before I begin, I would really like to express gratitude 🙌 towards **all the
people** who helped me in this long journey

- Especially **my wife** who was extremely patient as I spend long hours
  morning/night for months preparing and
- Couple of friends without whose support this would really not have have been
  possible.
- All the innumerable **mentors**, **creators** who actively shared there
  knowledge and experience via blogs, YouTube videos about this process which
  benefitted me immensely (I will list many of these resources in this post)

## The right mindset going into the process

As you start to read this post,

- You might be having multiple thoughts about the company, the interview process
  and whether you can even succeed through it all?
- You might be thinking, there are thousands of applicants for any particular
  position, Do **I** even stand a chance?

Let me tell you my friend, I experienced most of these thoughts first hand and
shared these doubts and while some of these thoughts were positively motivating,
others not so much.

And before your mind spirals any further, let me stop you right there and offer
you a simple piece of advice.

> Slow down, Breathe. 🧘🏼☺️!️ Take your time and don't give up! You got this!

### Its not a zero sum game

These interview loops are certainly not a piece of cake 🍰 and arguably quite
hard, Its very easy to go down a rabbit hole and let this be the **only** thing
that consumes everything in your life. But please don't.

At the end of the day, while a job at one of these companies is really coveted
and offers really nice perks/salary and learning opportunities, it is a job and
might not be the right fit for you and should definitely not take priority over
your or your loved ones physical and mental wellbeing.

### A note about failure 🙅‍♂️

Its also really easy to take interview **rejections really hard** and have
demotivating thoughts that you are not good enough, and I've also been a subject
to some of these rejections as I interviewed at other companies,

Just realize this happens to the best of us, sometimes **you might be under
prepared,** or might be having an **off day** or unfortunately **just get
stuck** and I think its only human for this to happen.

> You must fail fast and fail better!

An interview however stressful is sort of like a hard mirror to look at and
serves as a reminder of at what point of your preparation journey, you are at
and any failures does not mean you are not qualified but simply not as prepared.

I've learned that the correct mindset to approaching these interviews is to have
the below frame of mind.

- You are going to speak with some really cool and intelligent people from world
  class companies
- You have a chance to figure out and collaborate on a few interesting and
  challenging problems and take your best stab at it for 45-60 mins
- No matter the outcome, you'll walk away with knowledge about your own prep
  levels, any gaps you need to fill, work on and get better at
- Get a chance to ask questions, and learn more about the company culture and
  work

I first heard about this from
[Gergely Orosz a.k.a The pragmatic engineer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gergelyorosz/?originalSubdomain=nl)
in his YouTube Video
[Confessions from a Big Tech Hiring Manager: Tips for Software Engineering Interviews](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFOw_m5zNCs)
and I must say I completely agree that this is the **helpful** mindset people
should approach these interviews with.

## The Interview process overview

If you are still reading after that word of advice, You certainly want to give
this a shot 💪, So without further adieu, Let me get right to the point 👇

[Meta (previously known as facebook)](https://about.fb.com/news/2021/10/facebook-company-is-now-meta/)
as of 2021 has the below interview loop for Software Engineers position.

> **Please Note**: 📝 There are different roles within the company, such as
> Product/Production engineer, Quality specialist, QA Engineering
> lead/Engineering Manager, Android/iOS/Backend/AI/ML engineers and so on,
> please check with your recruiter as some of these rounds could have different
> **scope and objectives** and they are in the best position to confirm.

The below largely holds true for Software Engineering Interviews

- 1 Initial Recruiter screening
- 1 Screening Coding interview

Followed by a full onsite interview loop having total of 4 interviews of 45 mins
duration each.

- 2 Coding interviews
- 1 System design interview
- 1 Behavioral interview

Please read below sections for resources as well as tips on how to prepare for
each of these

## Step 1: Writing an effective resume ✍🏻

The first step to any interview journey is to write a good resume that helps in
making your case in front of the recruiter and hiring manager.

In most cases people will skim read your resume first so spending time and
making your resume concise and the best reflection of your skills is very
important.

Luckily there are many amazing resources out their with **sage** 📿 advice on
how to write effective resume.

Below are what I referenced heavily:

- [The Google resume by Gayle Laakmann mcdowell](https://www.amazon.co.uk/GOOGLE-RESUME-GAYLE-LAAKMANN-MCDOWELL/dp/8126538058/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=)
- [This Is What A GOOD Resume Should Look Like by Career cup](https://www.careercup.com/resume)

In general, writing a good resume is just like any other skill, you start with a
**good enough** version, and then keep on iterating and refining it till it
works quite well.

### Some Do's and don'ts of writing an effective resume

I've listed some helpful practices and some things to avoid in your resume.

**Do's:** ✅

- Mention technical items that show you are **smart** and **can code** and call
  out the impact you've had in previous roles
- Prefer writing a **1 page resume** (If your years of experience (YOE) is under
  10 years) and maximum 1.5 - 2 pages for more experienced candidates
- Please add only the relevant positions that makes you an impressive candidate
  for the role
- Write strong bullet points that convey impact for e.g. **"Accomplished X by
  implementing Y which led to Z"**, Show **what** you did, **how** you did and
  what were the **results**
- For project experience: Please list only the relevant and recent projects (in
  chronologically reverse order), Your resume does not have to be comprehensive
  work history but only include bits that are relevant to the position you are
  applying for
- For programming languages and software
  - **Softwares and Tools**: List only that very specific keywords, eliminate
    others, remember anything you put on your resume is **fair game** during an
    interview.
  - **Languages:** List only the ones which you are comfortable with and not
    everything
    > Tip: 💡 You can add proficiency level around the language: Python
    > (expert), Kotlin (proficient), Java (fluent)
- 🔺 Remember to **tailor** your resume to the role you are applying for, i.e.
  ensure your resume has those aspects highlighted that the given job
  description focusses on (**obviously while being authentic to your experiences
  and skills**).
  - This is quite an underrated activity but doing this could well mean the
    difference between, a resume reject vs getting that call from the recruiter.

**Don'ts:** ⛔🤦

- Don't include non tech hobbies as they don't matter much
- Adding no of years to a programming language is a poor metric, For instance,
  if you started working with a language 10 years ago but have used it only few
  times what is the no of years that you can claim?
- Do not add age, marital status, nationality as this sort of personal
  information can create a legal liability for US companies
- Remove lengthy certifications that are not relevant

## Step 2: Research and apply 💻

The next phase is to find the positions that you are interested in. With Covid,
the
[tech market become unusually hot](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/perfect-storm-causing-a-hot-tech-hiring-market)
and there was no shortage of roles for skilled candidates.

There are multiple job search engines available, the most prominent being
**LinkedIn**. You could setup job alerts 🚨 for the **companies, locations and
role** that meet your profile and then research and start applying to them.

> 💡 **Tip: Get a referral:** Once you find the opening you are interested in,
> Try to see if there is anyone in your network who is already working at the
> company and try to get a referral or introduction. Getting an employee
> referral puts your resume at the top of the priority list and has a high
> chance of being reviewed by the recruiter and the hiring manager. LinkedIn and
> Twitter are good spaces to build a network that you could leverage these later
> on if needed.

If you looking for a structured process to research and apply to companies, I
found this video by
[Jeff H Sipe](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs-7SAP1mhEQF1NlubjSzqQ) on
[How to Research a Company for a Job Interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXqznIrzh-s)
quite helpful, his YouTube channel also has excellent content on the interview
process backed by his multiple years of experience working as a recruiter at
Google.

> 🤔 **Self Reflection:** In my case, I had a close friend and colleague already
> working at meta and he forwarded my profile to the hiring manager and referred
> me for the role. Post speaking with the hiring manager, I was very excited by
> the role, team and the learning opportunity at hand and got the recruiter call
> shortly after. My own experience validated this idea of putting extra effort
> in getting a referral as it can give much better results

If you however don't know anyone at the company or people don't respond over
social networks, 🙁 go ahead and apply anyway. Some companies do screen inbound
resumes and I have personally also got few reach outs this way.

## Step 3: The recruiter screening

Once the recruiter is interested in your profile, they would probably reach out
to schedule a discussion over phone or video conference (VC). These
conversations are to better understand your profile and see if you are a fit.

As always **being authentic** to your experience and skills is important and
your honest answers would help the recruiter understand how much prep time you
would need for the interview loop.

Meta recruiters are amazing and they give sufficient time for you to prepare
well (even up to 6-8 weeks) and share lot of guidance and prep materials and
depending on how prepared your are, I would suggest to take that time. ⏲️

Contrary to some other companies, the interview process is fairly open and
transparent with very clear expectations laid out. This leaves very little room
for ambiguity and thus results in an excellent candidate experience.

> 💡 Tip: Remember to ask lot of good questions about the role and the interview
> process and get clarity for your specific role. Its perfectly fine to clarify
> the scope of the interview rounds and what can you reasonably expect. Also,
> being **kind and gracious** throughout the conversation can go a long way
> since you should realize that the recruiter is really on your side and its in
> their best interest to ensure you succeed.

## Step 4: The first Coding interview (Screening)

Meta has in total **3 rounds** of coding interviews. Your recruiter would
usually schedule an initial screening interview and depending on how well you
do, it would be followed by the full onsite interview loop having 2 more coding
interviews and few more

Succeeding in these coding interviews is a challenge for sure, but **definitely
doable**. Its a matter of practicing well, **consistently**.

These rounds focus on solving 2 algorithmic style problems focussed on **data
structures and algorithms, problem solving skills** and **communication and
collaboration skills** within a span of **40 minutes**, leaving 5 mins at the
end for questions.

Contrary to some other companies, where there is some time for introductions,
your interviewer would very quickly introduce themselves and then jump right
into the initial problem. What **area** or **skill** the problem would assess is
completely up to them and could be on any data structure or algorithm area in
the below list

### Data structures to know

- Array
- Stack
- Heap
- Queue
- Map
- List
- Linked list
- Trees (Binary Tree, Binary Search Tree, Ternary, N-ary)
  - [Prefix tree or trie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-urNrIAQnNo)
- Graphs

### Algorithm

- DFS (Depth first search)
- BFS (Breadth first search)
- Recursion
- Two pointers
- Sorting
- Dynamic programming (rare, but sometimes asked)

### How to prepare for DS and algorithm questions

People with a computer science engineering background have gone through these
Data structures and algorithms at least once in their life, however while
working professionally, most people understandably don't really remember all the
details off the top of their head

Depending on the amount of time you have for the interview its best to
understand the nuances of these different data structures and algorithms,
conceptually and then follow up with consistent practice solving problems

> **Self reflection:** 💡 I read through few books and sites first to get that
> theoretical base around DS and Algo, with books like
> [Cracking the coding interview by Gayle Laakmann McDowell](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Cracking-Coding-Interview-6th-Programming/dp/0984782850/),
> [Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures using Python By Brad Miller and David Ranum, Luther College](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published//pythonds/index.html)
> and
> [The Interview Cake Course](https://www.interviewcake.com/table-of-contents), however if you are short on time, I would 

and there are many more resources mentioned in Gergely's blog as well
[Preparing for the Systems Design and Coding Interview by Gergely Orosz](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/preparing-for-the-systems-design-and-coding-interviews/)

Once done with these, I also went through sections on **Arrays, Binary Search,
Linked list, Recursion, Graphs, Binary Trees** on
[Leet code](https://leetcode.com/explore/) and then mostly solved Top 100
questions asked by Facebook. Getting the premium subscription meant I could
access the solutions to these problems

I found this to be very useful for this interview loop. There are other sites
like [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) that is also used by some
companies.

> the same type since you should optimize for coverage than solid depth in one
> over the expense of others.

### Additional tips to keep in mind

- While practicing for coding rounds, ensure you **practice talking out loud**,
  this is very important skill to develop since if you hardly speak a word but
  still solve the problem it tells your interviewer very little signal about how
  good of a collaborator you are and this is something they look for.
- Try to **time yourself while solving these problems** and develop enough speed
  to solve the problems with optimal solution within 20 mins. Don't worry if you
  don't have the speed initially, as you solve more problems you'll start to
  recognize patterns that you could use and solve category of problems and
  you'll get faster.
- Practice daily, think of these problems as workout for your mind to ensure you
  don't get rusty. The more you practice, the more muscle memory you'll develop
  and the faster you would become.
- Please review solved problems every week (This is very important). Try and
  re-solve already solved problems since the forgetting curve is quite real. You
  can use a spaced repetition tool like Anki to even prompt same problems on a
  periodic basis
- Practicing these interviews with a buddy is amazing since they can give you
  actionable feedback for improvements, you could also leverage a community
  platform like [Pramp](https://www.pramp.com/#/) to do mock interviews. The
  more you do this, the better are your chances of success since you can share
  tips, and also for the much needed feedback
- Remember you should aim to solve the problem first even if its a naive
  solution, **done is better than perfect**. However don't stop as soon as you
  have the naive solution in place since you are expected to reach an optimal
  solution to the problem at hand if possible to get extra points.
- Ask clarification questions and check your assumptions
- Keep good communication with your interviewer, they can steer you into correct
  direction
- Practice solving questions with a time limit and without executing code
- Come up with edge cases once you write the solution, catch your bugs
- Focus on getting working solution first, **done is better than perfect**
- Prepare good test cases, candidates forget coming up with good edge cases
- If you are stuck on first one, you can ask to move to the 2nd question
- Ideally should be able finish 1st question very strongly
- Practice solving medium problems within 20 mins for coding interview
  - Clarify the question 1 - 2 mins
  - Start problem solving, Discuss solutions, ask more clarifying questions (5-7
    mins)
    - Cover time and space complexity
  - Go to coding (8 mins)
  - Leave 2 mins for tests
- Do not look up functions on internet, if you are not sure, you can say can i
  use a placeholder and mostly interviewers are looking at thought process
- Expected to implement the data structure
- Onsite coding questions are same and expectations are also mostly same for all
  the levels
- Don't come up with too many test cases, come up with minimal length of test
  cases
  - Come up with 1 happy path
  - Think more about edge cases
- Test the cases in the end and put them in comments
- Variable names are used to assess, simple for loops its fine.

## System design Interview

The system design interview is an interview round to assess how well do you
understand design and architecture of systems and given a vague problem, can you
clarify and design a high level system and then dive deep into few components.

You could be asked to design any system, there are mostly commonly talked about
systems like WhatsApp, DropBox/Google Drive, Instagram, Twitter, Type ahead
search, Search Engine, Web crawler or it could be a niche use case. Really
understanding all the concepts around system design is how you can excel in this
round

Depending on the role you are looking for the scope of this round can change
thus clarifying with your recruiter is very important. For e.g. for a product
engineer the focus might be more on how do you design the API and database
schema for the backend system whereas for an Infra engineer the focus could be
how well does the candidate consider different systems (Db, cache, load
balancing, security) and other concerns

### Expectations from system design round

Below are the expectations from this round and performance in this gives a very
good signal as to the target level of the candidate.

- You are expected to design and build a distributed system from scratch
- How well do you gather requirements and explore the problem first
- How well do you do quantitative analysis, work out the scale, size of data
  that you will be working with
- Do you consider tradeoffs for the design choices
- How well do you deep dive into components and details
- How do you reason how the data is stored, secured and structured
- Do you need too much prompting, can you lead the conversation

There are some excellent resources for preparing for system design and I'd
recommend any of these

### System design Interview tips

- For system design, interviewer can reply to questions, but you need to lead
  the discussion
- Think of your interviewer as a junior engineer who you are giving an overview
  of the system
- Keep track of topics you want to cover so that you don't forget them and the
  time. This is a common mistake to not manage time well
- Clarifying ambiguity is great but you should time bound it
  - General outline
  - 5 mins for clarifying questions
  - 10 - 12 mins to go broad and make a high level design
  - 10 mins to go deep into 2-3 components and elaborate on the design
- For system design, we use **ExcaliDraw** as a standardized tool
- Is the system design product design or system design
  - product design
    - mostly about API, not infra heavy
  - How will you store the data, how do you design the schema
    - System design: Backend systems, how do you scale the backend
    - Think about memory, availability
- Try to have a mock interview, make sure you practice
- Leading the interviewer means how you break it down and explain it to a junior
  engineer, treat interviewer as a junior engineer

## Resources for system design

### YouTube:

I personally referred to videos on multiple you tube channels (often even while
during house hold chores to really soak the different concepts)

## Behavioral Interview

Behavioral interview is mostly to see if you would be a fit for the role at the
company. This is a non coding/design round wherein the interviewer is more
interested in how you work with the teams, are you a good communicator and
collaborator, also can you verbalize your impact to the teams and products you
have worked upon.

This interview gives pretty good signal on your leadership skills, seniority and
taste of whether you would fit in.

### How to prepare for behavioral interviews

- You should revisit your work history and make note of the projects you worked
  on where you had good impact, usually you can follow the
  [STAR](https://www.amazon.jobs/en/landing_pages/in-person-interview) format
  (**STAR = Situation, Task, Actions, Result**)
- Have the data ready for projects you are more proud off and be ready to talk
  about it in detail while being authentic, remember your interviewers are
  seasoned professionals and they can usually cross question you in case
  something does not add up. Please don't lie or over glorify your
  contributions. In this case, Honestly is definitely the correct policy
- Also reflect on which project that did not go well and how did you fail and
  what were your learnings.
- Anything in your CV is fair game, talk about what You have done, specific
- Make sure you lead and drive the conversation and give your answer with enough
  detail and with data.
- Speak about what **YOU** did and your specific contributions to the success of
  a project, instead of saying **WE**
- Convey key points about you responsibilities, projects that you lead,
  initiatives that you took
- Be concise but detailed enough to give context

### Focus areas

While interviewing, the interviewers want to see how well do you exhibit
behaviors that are valuable to the team and inline with company values

Meta has below
[5 company values](https://www.facebookcareers.com/facebook-life/):

- Move fast
- Be bold
- Be open
- Build social value
- Focus on Impact

Towards this, your interviewers are interested in finding out:

- Can you work in unstructured environment
  ([VUCA](https://hbr.org/2014/01/what-vuca-really-means-for-you))
- Do you exhibit a Growth mindset towards learning and working?
- Do you have empathy towards other people on your team?
- How good are your communication skills and how do you speak about colleagues?
- Do you have the ability to resolve disagreements?
- How well do you use data to solve problems?
- Do you exhibit perseverance and how well do you deliver results?
- Are you a self starter and motivated to make an impact?

## Bonus: Questions to ask your interviewers

At the end of any interview round, you get 5 minutes to ask interview questions
from your interviewers. Remember the company is investing a lot of precious
company time of its smart people to interview you, so make sure you ask lots of
good questions and really understand the company, its people, culture. It should
be what matters most to you and what care about.

Do not waste this time asking questions to which you can easy find answers on
google like company perks, technology stacks or how well did you do on the
interview. 😉, You'll get to know that sooner or later anyway

If you want a sample list of questions to ask, I found this excellent video by
Jeff H Sipe on what questions you can ask, feel free to take this and modify as
per your unique role and situation
[Questions to Ask Your Interviewer - Jeff H Sipe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sjcuHD-hXc)
