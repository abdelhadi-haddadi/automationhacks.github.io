Let's take a simple code example as below:

{% gist f82126b921e80519c9fb19d95f6556e7 %}

If we execute this code:

```text
Quacked
Louder Quack
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/Users/gaurav/personal/development/grasp-python/base/advanced/duck_typing.py", line 33, in <module>
    MakeItQuack(Eagle())
  File "/Users/gaurav/personal/development/grasp-python/base/advanced/duck_typing.py", line 29, in __init__
    bird.quack()
AttributeError: 'Eagle' object has no attribute 'quack'
```

Observe here we are passing an object `bird` to `MakeItQuack` class constructor and invoking
`quack()` on the passed object.

Thus classes which have an implementation of `quack` method will be able to call _(Duck, AnotherDuck
objects)_ whereas we get a `AttributeError` if we try to pass an object which does not provide an
implementation of `quack()`&nbsp;,herethe `Eagle` class.

This is the essence of duck typing. Having the ability to do this without writing an Interface is
really awesome.
