If you are already aware of what [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/),
[virtualenvwrapper](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and
[pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) is in the python ecosystem and have also heard or used
[pipenv](https://realpython.com/pipenv-guide/) and are just grepping for the commands to use to
quickly set up and run an environment, then just refer to below:

### TL;DR üòâ

How to create a virtualenv with pipenv

If you thinking something along the lines of

> I am aware of how to use **requirements.txt** file in python and have used virtualenvs previously,
> it works fine for my needs, frankly what is this pipenv module and why should I care? ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Then do read on further for a bit of a long winding story üç∑

## First, A bit of context ü§ì

In python, the packaging story has had lots of options. Just take a look
<a rel="noopener" href="https://packaging.python.org/guides/tool-recommendations/" target="_blank">here</a>
if you want to understand what all options are available.

A tried and tested approach to quickly create a reproducible env for you app has been to use
**virtualenv¬†**module and install all the modules required using **pip¬†**and then capture them with
pinned dependencies versions using **requirements.txt**

Below is a sample requirements.txt file with pinned dependencies

<pre class="wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code">certifi==2020.6.20
chardet==3.0.4
idna==2.10
requests==2.24.0
urllib3==1.25.9</pre>

### Why do we need virtualenvs? Can't I just install the modules on my base python installation?

This is a beginner question which every person new to Python and its ecosystem asks.

Well, The short answer is you can absolutely do that. However it's not the recommended option.

Why? You might ask, Let me give you an example.

Let's say I use **Python 3.8** for my personal projects and want to use `requests` module version of
1.2.0.

But at work, we as a team have still have not shifted to the latest version and are using **Python
3.5¬†** with another version of `requests = 1.0.2` (example)

Supporting this workflow is possible by creating two different **virtualenvs** with different python
versions and I can quickly activate the required environment for use. It's also quite trivial to
destroy this environment and rebuild it again in case the environment is polluted or some dependency
is breaking your app.

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-large">
  <p>
    üí° <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Please <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>DO NOT</strong> install</span> modules in your base python version (installed/pre-installed via the OS). You might accidentally update the version of a dependency which might break something in your system/project. <strong>Always use virtualenvs.</strong> üôèüèª
  </p>
</blockquote>

Also, There are already
<a rel="noopener" href="https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/#useful-links" target="_blank">abstractions
built over
</a>**<a rel="noopener" href="https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/#useful-links" target="_blank">virtualenv</a>&nbsp;**such
as **virtualenvwrapper&nbsp;**and **tox&nbsp;**that make it a bit more convenient to use
the&nbsp;**venv&nbsp;**(module for virtualenv). Diving into how they work is probably a story for
another time. ü§î

## A new hope ‚òÄÔ∏è

<p class="has-drop-cap">
  <strong>Pipenv</strong> is the new solution to this packaging story and it wraps over pip, virtualenv and provides a lot of virtualenvwrapper like capabilities while makes it super convenient to set up dependencies for your project.
</p>

It is written by <a rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/kennethreitz" target="_blank">Kenneth
Reitz</a> of **requests** module fame and is actively maintained by the python community. This tool
has very quickly risen to become the recommended tool for Application dependency management by
python. This is higher level tool than pip and can make it very easy for multiple contributors to
work/manage dependencies in a large project

Let's see how to install, setup and create a virtualenv for a project all via pipenv. We would use
terminal commands and see how to work with pipenv. However if you are using an editor like Pycharm,
we will also see how to set it up there.

## Installation üñ•

To install pipenv, you can use homebrew on mac/linux

<pre class="wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code">brew install pipenv</pre>

Or, Alternatively, You can also use pip directly with a
[user installation](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/#user-installs) to install pipenv

<pre class="wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code">pip install --user pipenv</pre>

## Pre-requisites

If you work with multiple python projects on your machine, it is a good practice to store the
virtualenvs in a central directory which you can easily refer to later on.

To enable that, we need to add an environment variable `WORKON_HOME` in a shell configuration file
of your choice (`.zshrc`, or `.bash_profile`)

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
  <p>
    ‚ÑπÔ∏è In the absence of WORKON_HOME variable being set, pipenv would simply create the virtualenv in the current terminal dir
  </p>
</blockquote>

<pre class="wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code">export WORKON_HOME=~/virtualenvs
export VIRTUALENVWRAPPER_PYTHON=/usr/local/bin/python3
export LANG=en_US.UTF-8
export LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8</pre>

## Create a project and virtualenv

Go to the project for which you want to create a virtualenv for, and then execute below command

<pre class="wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code">cd test_project
pipenv --three </pre>

Executing the above command would give an output like below, notice it **creates a virtualenv** in
`<strong>WORKON_HOME</strong>` directory with the name of the project followed by a string.
(`test_project-UdkZ3s0t`)

<pre class="wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code">Creating a virtualenv for this project‚Ä¶

‚úî Successfully created virtual environment!
Virtualenv location: /Users/gaurav/virtualenvs/test_project-UdkZ3s0t</pre>

## Activate the environment

To open a shell with the already created virtualenv

```zsh
pipenv shell
```

You would see something like below:

<pre class="wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code">Launching subshell in virtual environment‚Ä¶
 . /Users/gaurav/virtualenvs/test_project-UdkZ3s0t/bin/activate
‚ûú  test_project  . /Users/gaurav/virtualenvs/test_project-UdkZ3s0t/bin/activate
(test_project) ‚ûú  test_project</pre>

Notice that pipenv is invoking `<strong>/bin/activate</strong>` inside our created virtualenv just
as you manually would if you were not using a higher level tool like `virtualenvwrapper`

## Installing package

To install any module in this newly created environment, type the module name from
[PyPi](https://pypi.org/).

Below, we are installing `requests` module

<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>pipenv install requests</code></pre>

The above command outputs below.

<pre class="wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code">Installing requests‚Ä¶
Adding requests to Pipfile's [packages]‚Ä¶
‚úî Installation Succeeded

Couple of things to note:

1. **pipenv** creates a `Pipfile.lock` file (if it does not exist already)
2. Once the module is installed it updates `Pipfile.lock` file
3. Finally using the lock file it installs the dependencies

## The Pipfile

Pipenv creates a `Pipfile` to keep all the required information about your dependencies. Let's
inspect it's contents

<pre class="wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code">[[source]]
name = "pypi"
url = "https://pypi.org/simple"
verify_ssl = true

[dev-packages]

[packages]
requests = "*"

[requires]
python_version = "3.8"</pre>

Pipfile mentions the version of python required by this project under `[requires]` and has also
specified `requests = "*"` under `[packages]`, notice, the `*` wildcard means we don't care about a
specific version of `requests` as long as the latest version is installed.

This is different from pinning the dependency to a specific version like: `requests = 2.24.0` and
offers more flexibility since pipenv would figure out the dependency graph and ensure that all the
required dependencies of `requests` module are automatically updated.

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-large">
  <p>
    üí° For the people from the JVM world, a parallel can be drawn to <code>build.gradle</code> or <code>pom.xml</code> files wherein we specify which repository to pick the library from, the packages to import and the language version to use
  </p>
</blockquote>

## Pipfile.lock

In addition to Pipfile, pipenv creates a `Pipfile.lock` as well which has finer level details about
the specific version of packages that are installed in the virtualenv.

Notice, any changes made manually to this can be overwritten if you update pipfile (with some new
package) and then run `pipenv update`

If you check the content of `Pipfile.lock`, you can notice that it maintains the version of the
module and its **direct**, **transitive dependencies**, This ensures pipenv is able to reproduce the
exact runtime environment every time

```json
    "_meta": {
        "hash": {
            "sha256": "acbc8c4e7f2f98f1059b2a93d581ef43f4aa0c9741e64e6253adff8e35fbd99e"

            "version": "==1.25.9"
        }
    },
    "develop": {}
```

## Compatibility with requirements.txt

If you use `requirements.txt` file extensively with your project. You can easily generate a file
using pipenv.

<pre class="wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code">pipenv lock -r &gt; requirements.txt</pre>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-large">
  <p>
    Also, if your project already has a requirements.txt file then while doing <code>pipenv install</code>, pipenv would automatically pick it up and install the required packages.
  </p>
</blockquote>

## Tearing down a virtualenv

Removing a virtualenv is as simple as executing `pipenv --rm`

<pre class="wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code">(test_project) ‚ûú  test_project pipenv --rm
Removing virtualenv (/Users/gaurav/virtualenvs/test_project-UdkZ3s0t)‚Ä¶</pre>

## Setting up a virtualenv using Pycharm editor

Pycharm provides a convenient way to use/and create a pipenv

### Select an env

1. Open settings
2. Go to project interpreter
3. If you have a pipenv that you want to share across multiple projects then select it from the drop
   down
4. Else, Tap on the `...` button on top right and click on **Add new**

![Pycharm project interpretor](/assets/images/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/pycharm_project_interpretor.png)

### Create a pipenv

If you want to create a fresh env then click on Pipenv environment and select the base interpreter
as the desired version to use.

![Create pipenv](/assets/images/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/create_pipenv.png)

### Select an existing env

Alternatively, If you have already created a **pipenv** via command line, then you can select it by
clicking on **Virtualenv environment** and under **Existing environment**, navigating till the path
where your virtualenv resides and select `/bin/python`

![Select existing virtualenv](/assets/images/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/select_existing_virtualenv.png)

## Conclusion

Pipenv is a **really** powerful tool that makes working with virtualenvs and dependencies a breeze.
If you have not yet tried it out, I would highly recommend you to check it out.

If you found this post useful, Do share it with a friend or colleague. Until next time. Happy
coding.
