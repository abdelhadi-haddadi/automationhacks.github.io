_My Experience as a first time speaker in a test automation conference and the awesome talks and tools that I learned about._<figure class="wp-caption">

Appium Conf had its 2nd edition in the garden city of india between 13‚Äì15 June 2019 and had an impressive lineup of <a href="https://confengine.com/appium-conf-2019/speaker" target="_blank">speakers</a> from all across the world with so many cool things to share with the community. This post is a summary of what sessions I personally attended and what i learned from them, as well as an inside track into how it felt to deliver my first ever conference talk.

With that set, Let‚Äôs jump right in.

With three parallel tracks set, It was impossible to attend all of them so I selected my schedule based on the topics or speakers who had a higher calling to me personally. The <a href="https://confengine.com/appium-conf-2019/schedule#" target="_blank">ConfEngine</a> app has this sweet web/mobile app to allow you to see what sessions are playing right now as well as the ones you **want to attend** and add them as a calendar invite so sniffing through them was pain at all.

Also all of these sessions were being recorded so I am glad that we can go back in time and listen to the wealth of information in them. üòÉ

### Day 1<figure>

#### <a href="https://confengine.com/appium-conf-2019/proposal/9574/appium-the-next-generation" target="_blank">Jonathan Lipps‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäAppium: The Next Generation</a>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWXQ_TRYKic" target="_blank">Video</a> is already out. But apart from the plans to make appium more pluggable and vision to ensure it keeps up with changes in mobile tech. The best highlight of this keynote was when Jonathan showed off an Appium driver for raspberry Pi and how he could use it to play a live drum sequence. Checkout the <a href="https://github.com/jlipps/appium-raspi-driver" target="_blank">code here</a>.

<a href="https://medium.com/u/6ddbd027381e" target="_blank">Angie Jones</a> **live demoed** how to use Applitools to add additional intelligence to the UI tests and how easy it is to control what level of granularity you want in your verifications. To beat it all off, while the appium test was running she had super cool beats to listen to.

          Well, Had to attend this one since I <strong>was the one giving it</strong>. üòÅ I aimed to give a set of strategies that engineers can follow to ensure they are able to reduce test flakiness to a minimum and this was heavily if not all inspired by a series of articles written on <a href="https://appiumpro.com/editions" target="_blank">appium pro</a> by Appium Team and other webinars given by Jonathan. Giving this talk was a really good exercise in public speaking and not only did I learn a lot, I realized that I could actually talk in front of people and convey an idea. Looking forward to helping the community out in future talks as well. Here are the <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/key/zA1rir4oIv97k6?feature=oembed" target="_blank">slides</a> in case you want to check it out.

              Great talk by Dan in which he explained how much of espresso‚Äôs capabilities can be easily leveraged in appium and this support is only gonna grow better. His explanation of how espresso works and examples on Idling resource were really helpful.

              Boy is pradeep a gem of a person to talk to. He spoke a lot about the theory behind testing and shared stories around his years of experience solving pains felt by him as a tester in different companies. The key takeaway for me was really to not be limited by the problem space but think of how we can create tools/utilities to make our life as a tester so much easier.

                  It‚Äôs not everyday that you get to hear from the creator to Selenium, Founder of Sauce Labs and Tapster in person and this was this one of the highlights of this conference for me. He talked about how his company <a href="https://www.tapster.io/" target="_blank">Tapster robotics</a> is building robots to perform automation for different use cases and this was super cool.

                          These amazing speakers had practical advice on handing some hard to automate scenarios using <a href="http://appium.io/docs/en/commands/mobile-command/" target="_blank">native mobile commands</a>

                          Boy this was my favourite talk in all of appium conf. Jonah in a 90 mins talk walked through around 180 appium desired capabilities and even demoed how he goes about finding what each one of them does all while keeping the talk incredibly funny. He also setup <a href="https://caps.cloudgrey.io" target="_blank">caps.cloudgrey.io</a> to host all of these tagged with different levels of complexity and am sure this would be an awesome community resource going forward.

                          My exact sentiment with this talk was:
