In the last part [Hello, espresso! Part 4 Working with Idling resources
üò¥]({% link _posts/2022-05-14-hello-espresso-part-4-idling-resources.md %}),

We understood how to use espresso idling resources to achieve synchronization
when the app is running background tasks that espresso is not aware of. Go ahead
and have a read in case you missed it.

## Automating hybrid apps with WebViews

Switching gears to a different topic now, many apps expose certain business
logic in WebViews (a.k.a a mobile browser),

For example a help or support page for your business that needs to be dynamic
and change whenever a new page/option is added or some marketing content is
launched, Or even lengthy terms and conditions for a new feature

In these cases, its important that we have confidence that when the user
interacts with these `WebViews`, the interactions work well
