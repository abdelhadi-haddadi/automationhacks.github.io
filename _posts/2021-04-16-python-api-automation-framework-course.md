This post is a **really short** announcement.

I'm really happy üòÑ and excited to announce that the video course for the entire blog series on
building an API test automation framework using Python is live on
[Test automation university](https://testautomationu.applitools.com) under the
[API Python path](https://testautomationu.applitools.com/learningpaths.html?id=api-python-path)

[Course link: üëâüèº API Testing in python](https://testautomationu.applitools.com/python-api-testing/)

As always, this is a **FREE** offering for the community on the platform

We dive deeper into each of these areas (covered in the blog) and I throw out additional insights
and anecdotes along the way

Thanks to the platform you have full transcripts available with source code links and even quizzes
to test whether you got everything down

Go ahead. Dig in. üòâ

As always, Do share this with your friends or colleagues and if you have thoughts or feedback, I'd
be more than happy to chat over at twitter or comments. Until next time. Happy Testing and coding.

Here is the entire course in blogs as well.
