Hi there ðŸ˜„

I've recently moved the blog away from Wordpress and have dived into the wonderful word of static
site generators using Jekyll and Github pages. This post talks about how the overall process looked
like and what were some of the additional customizations I added along with references. Let's get
started.

## Why

Why? You might ask, Well, Wordpress had been great for me initially. It enabled me to start blogging
without any consideration of the technical setup needed and it was quite easy to have a fully
featured blog within minutes

However over time, the overall experience felt a bit bloated and what i realized is that I do not
really make use of all the capability that Wordpress as a platform offered.

Also, For any new functionality that I might need, I had to **add Wordpress plugins** (and that
requires a business plan at the least)

It conflicted with my goals of having a minimal, fast technical blog/portfolio site that I have full
control over and customize to whatever needs might arise and this ultimately motivated me to take
the plunge and move away from Wordpress

## Welcome to the world of static site generators (SSG)

I had been aware of static site generators before and had heard of **Jekyll, Hugo, Sphinx** among
many others. Watched a few videos around this and ultimately found Jekyll to have the required
functionality and customization for my needs

One of the motivating factors in favor of Jekyll was that it has a very tight integration with
Github, plus the hosting of the site is **very graciously** taken care of by Github. I had to only
buy the domain on Namecheap and do setup and the site was good to go. ðŸ™Œ

The icing on the top was that my entire workflow involves writing posts in plain markdown and then
using Git and Github for the publishing workflow. Can't get more minimal than that. ðŸ˜†

There were many good tutorials that other people had **already** put out for this process and that i
referred while migrating, check them out

- [WebJeda - 4 Steps To Migrate From WordPress To Jekyll](https://blog.webjeda.com/wordpress-to-jekyll-migration/)

Below are the steps that I took and my experience around it.

## Download content from Wordpress and import into Jekyll

Depending on which platform your current blog is hosted on, there are different importers that you
could use to convert the dumps to a format that Jekyll can understand

My site was hosted on `wordpress.com` and so I had to download the content and then run
[Jekyll import tool](https://import.jekyllrb.com/)

Once done with above, It gave me a sample layout with all the images and other posts in `_posts`
directory

## Install ruby and gems

Jekyll docs are very well written and explain these in detail, Before starting ensure you have Ruby,
RubyGems and other libs setup. Follow instructions from
[Jekyll Quickstart](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/)

Once done, Below are the steps to create a new Jekyll site

Create an empty Jekyll site with default minima theme

```zsh
jekyll new <yourname.github.io>
```

> Note: You should have a repository with yourname.github.io in GitHub already, You can either
> create it first and then clone and then run above command or use
> `git remote add origin <your_repo_url>` >
> [Read more here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/using-git/adding-a-remote)

You can serve the newly created site on localhost, which you can access on port 4000.
[localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000/):

```zsh
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

In Jekyll, posts are maintained in `_posts` directory and are ordered in `yyyy-mm-dd-<title>`
format, You can also write drafts in `_drafts` folder and Jekyll is smart enough to not serve these
on your site until you are ready and move it under posts

If you want to view drafts in your local served Jekyll website

```zsh
jekyll serve --draft
```

## Push to GitHub and you are live

Once you push the site to Github it would take a couple of minutes for it to be setup

### Setting up domain

You can go with the default domain (`.github.io`) or setup your own.

To setup your own domain, create a file `CNAME` in folder root and add your domain name

```zsh
automationhacks.io
```

#### Modify Github settings

You also would need to add this domain in your repositories settings

Add this domain in **Custom domain** and also select Enforce HTTPS if your domain supports SSL. Read
more about how to do this on
[Github docs](https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site#configuring-a-subdomain)

### Update DNS provider

You can very easily buy a domain of whatever provider you want. I use namecheap for my site and you
need to setup `A record` in your Advanced DNS settings. Note the IP address of Github servers might
have changed so figure out the latest ones and replace in your settings

![Namecheap DNS config](/assets/images/2020/09/dns.png)

> Once the setting has been done in your Github repository and the domain provider. Wait for some
> time for the setting to take effect. Usually a few hours but can take max of upto 24 hours

## Let's start customizing with plugins

Jekyll uses [`Gems`](https://rubygems.org/) for most of the additional functionality that you might
need and associated plugins, Below is the basic process for installing and adding any new Gem into
the site

Add below lines in `_config.yml` under `group :jekyll_plugins do`, Below are the ones that I have
initially added and few of which I would explain in further sections or future blog posts

```ruby
group :jekyll_plugins do
  gem "jekyll-feed", "~> 0.12"
  gem "jekyll-seo-tag", "~> 2.6"
  gem "jekyll-gist"
end
```

You can then install all the gems mentioned in `Gemfile` using below:

```zsh
bundle install
```

Then, add these under plugins list in `_config.yml`

```yml
plugins:
  - jekyll-feed
  - jekyll-paginate
  - jekyll-seo-tag
  - jekyll-gist
  - jekyll-twitter-plugin
```

## Some manual fixes to be made

The export and import process leaves some cleanup activities to be done on the posts/pages, For a
large enough site you might want to automate some of these

### Encoded Strings

- You might see some encoded strings show up and might want to replace with character listed next:

```zsh
&#8217; <single quote>
&nbsp; <space>
```

### Get Github gists to render

- Also if you've been using Github gists for code samples, You might find these not rendered on the
  page. To fix these, Find the html code blocks with data-gist and replace with below liquid tag,
  The cool thing here is that since its your own Github account, you only need to specify the UUID
  like ID for gists to be rendered

```text
gist d366955370d58dc2ca40c185b62cd829
```

Enclosed with liquid tags

### Fix images

You can move all the images downloaded from Wordpress into an `assets/images` folder and then fix
the references in your posts/pages such that they are served from your repository

Some steps for the same can be:

- Search for `<figure> or <img>` tag and replace it with markdown syntax of
  `![image alt text](path_to_assets)` or change the `src` attribute, You might have all the images
  in a `wp-content` folder and so the easiest thing is to move the entire folder under
  `assets/images` and then fix the references to these images
- To be more specific, replace all image URLs beginning with `/wp-content` with
  `/assets/images/wp-content`

### Optional updates

- Search for `<pre>` tag and replace with code-block in order to get syntax highlighting using
  Jekyll rouge
- If you are cross posting your blog on sites like `dev.to` or `medium`, then you might want to
  update the canonical_url so that your new blog site is the
  [canonical reference](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/139066?hl=en)
- Finally check local site if all looks good at `http://127.0.0.1:4000/` before pushing to Github

> Note: There would be lot of HTML mixed with markdown in the blog and while you can certainly fix
> them into a markdown syntax, it would take a long time. I decided to let it be as long as the
> URLs/Images were fine

## Comments

To setup comments on the blog, i chose `disqus.com`, The process is quite simple and you need to
create an account on Disqus and then make couple of changes into your `_config.yml`

```yml
# Disqus Comments
disqus:
  # Leave shortname blank to disable comments site-wide.
  # Disable comments for any post by adding `comments: false` to that post's YAML Front Matter.
  shortname: <your_shortname>
```

This would start showing the Disqus comment block if your page has `comments: true` in the front
matter

If you want to ensure that comments are enabled on all the pages then add below defaults to your
`_config.yml`, this is sweet :laughing: because you don't need to repeat the same values in all the
posts frontmatter.

```yml
defaults:
  - scope:
      path: ""
      type: "posts"
    values:
      layout: "post"
      author: Gaurav
      comments: true
```

## Setup Google analytics

You might want to hook up Google analytics or equivalent to get some idea on your audience. Create
an account on Google analytics and that should give you a unique id. Update that in your config.yml
file and you are good to go with basic analytics.

Obviously there are more customizations that can be done, but that would probably be a future post

```yml
# Google Analytics
google_analytics: <unique_id>
```

> Psst: ðŸ¤«: Refer to [this](https://desiredpersona.com/google-analytics-jekyll/) for more details

## Summary

Voila, You have a fully customizable site up and running. I will be posting more about this in the
future as I learn more about Jekyll.

If you found this post useful, Do share it with a friend or colleague. Until next time. Happy
testing.
