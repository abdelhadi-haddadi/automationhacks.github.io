This is the final blog in this series where we explored gRPC testing and automation.

A quick recap, In the previous blogs in this series, we explored testing different layers of the test pyramid within gRPC context:

- [What gRPC is, using web UI to explore the API](https://newsletter.automationhacks.io/p/testing-grpc-1-set-up-a-grpc-server)
- How to unit [test the server](https://newsletter.automationhacks.io/p/testing-grpc-2-how-to-unit-test-a)
- How to unit test the [client code](https://newsletter.automationhacks.io/p/testing-grpc-3-how-to-unit-test-a-grpc-client).
- How to [E2E test a server method](https://newsletter.automationhacks.io/p/testing-grpc-4-how-to-e2e-test-a-grpc-service?utm_source=profile&utm_medium=reader2)

Please feel free to catch up on those before reading this one.

## What you‚Äôll learn? üå±

In this blog, I‚Äôll explore how to setup a load test written in Java leveraging locust4j library to setup a locust slave.

Our slave worker will push aggregated results to a python based locust server.

I hope you are also excited like I am to explore this topic.

Let‚Äôs go üèÉ

## Why write load tests?

Any modern successful business is bound to hit scale at some point in their journey. When it does, you don‚Äôt want to caught with a bad surprise wherein your systems are not able to scale, handle faults gracefully.

Load testing prepares engineering teams for such events.

Identifying how the system holds up with next level of scale is extremely important.

A system that is not scalable, reliable or fault tolerant when put under stress would let down its users and often that means direct revenue loss or even worse losing a customers trust.

Preventing such bugs to leak to production should be an acceptance criteria for any service seeing the light of the day in production.

## ‚öì Setup locust master

I hope we are on the same page that writing load tests are super important.

Let‚Äôs focus on understanding how to do this for our route guide service

We will use popular load testing framework called locust for this example. I had previously explored how to write a locust python test on a mock API. Please feel free to give it[a read](https://automationhacks.io/2019/07/28/how-to-setup-a-load-test-via-locust/) if interested

[How to setup a load test via Locust - automation hacks](https://automationhacks.io/2019/07/28/how-to-setup-a-load-test-via-locust/)

We will need python3 to be installed on our machine.

Most modern mac comes with python3 pre-installed, if not, you can follow this wonderful guide to [Properly Installing Python](https://docs.python-guide.org/starting/installation/)

We will also setup virtualenv to install required dependency, in this case locust and will use Pipenv. You can read [How to manage your python virtualenvs with Pipenv - Automation Hacks](https://automationhacks.io/2020/07/12/how-to-manage-your-python-virtualenvs-with-pipenv/) to get familiar with Pipenv

Below is a short summary:

Ensure you have below setup in your .zshrc, .bash_profile or in your windows system environment variables

```zsh
# One time setup
# Set below in .zshrc or .bash_profile depending upon the type of shell you are using
export WORKON_HOME=~/virtualenvs
export VIRTUALENVWRAPPER_PYTHON=/usr/local/bin/python3
export LANG=en_US.UTF-8
export LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8
```

Next install pipenv using python3

```zsh
pip3 install pipenv
```

You can then clone or take a pull from this repository [GitHub - automationhacks/grasp-grpc: Ports routeguide example service from grpc-java repository and adds functional and non functional API tests](https://github.com/automationhacks/grasp-grpc) and ensure you cd to folder with Pipfile

Run below to start virtualenv

```zsh
pipenv shell
```

Finally, we‚Äôll start our locust master server using:

```zsh
locust -f locust_master.py --master --master-bind-host=127.0.0.1 --master-bind-port=5557
```

You‚Äôll see something like this

```zsh
[2024-05-31 08:29:15,073] Gauravs-Laptop/INFO/locust.main: Starting web interface at http://0.0.0.0:8089
[2024-05-31 08:29:15,078] Gauravs-Laptop/INFO/locust.main: Starting Locust 2.28.0
```

What does this command do?

Here we are running a dummy locust server in **master** mode and binding the server to **localhost** and a random port **5557**. In a production setup, this script could be running on a remote server which we would use in our tests.

Below is how [locust_master.py](https://github.com/automationhacks/grasp-grpc/blob/main/locust_master.py) looks like:

```python
from locust import User, TaskSet, task

class DummyTask(TaskSet):
   @task(1)
   def dummy(self):
       pass

class Dummy(User):
   tasks = [DummyTask]
```

Here we init **DummyTask** as a sub class of **TaskSet** and have a method dummy with a weight of 1 using the **@task()** annotation.

Weight is a way in locust to increase the probability of a certain task to be picked ahead of others. In this case, we have a single task so it does not really matter.

```python
class DummyTask(TaskSet):
   @task(1)
   def dummy(self):
       pass
```

We also have the Dummy class of type User with our tasks list with this DummyTask

```python
class Dummy(User):
   tasks = [DummyTask]
```

## Generate required files using proto compiler

Ensure all relevant files are generated using gRPC proto compiler by executing below.

```zsh
./gradlew installDist
```

You only need to run this if you've made some changes to the proto message or RPC. This step could be skipped if there are no changes. In a prod setup, you may have a automation process that updates dependencies as part of a CI/CD pipeline

## Start gRPC server

Next, let‚Äôs ensure our server and API is up by executing below

```zsh
./build/install/grasp-grpc/bin/route-guide-server
```

You‚Äôll see something like this

```zsh
SLF4J: Failed to load class "org.slf4j.impl.StaticLoggerBinder".
SLF4J: Defaulting to no-operation (NOP) logger implementation
SLF4J: See http://www.slf4j.org/codes.html#StaticLoggerBinder for further details.
May 31, 2024 8:34:47 AM io.automationhacks.routeguide.RouteGuideServer start
INFO: Server started, listening on 8980
```

## Writing a locust slave

The key component of this load test is a locust slave written in Java that can be used by locust4j to start load test.

I‚Äôve added an example slave in [RouteGuideLoadGen.java](https://github.com/automationhacks/grasp-grpc/blob/33726eac548214c586e9d372fe9b998733f45d8a/src/main/java/io/automationhacks/routeguide/perf/RouteGuideLoadGen.java#L8)

And it looks like below:

```java
package io.automationhacks.routeguide.perf;

import com.github.myzhan.locust4j.Locust;
import io.automationhacks.routeguide.perf.tasks.GetFeatureTask;

import static io.automationhacks.routeguide.constants.Constants.*;

public class RouteGuideLoadGen {

 public void getFeatureLoad() {
   var locust = configureLocustMaster();

   locust.run(new GetFeatureTask(1));
 }

 private Locust configureLocustMaster() {
   var locust = Locust.getInstance();

   locust.setMasterHost(LOCUST_MASTER_HOST);
   locust.setMasterPort(LOCUST_MASTER_PORT);
   locust.setMaxRPS(LOCUST_MAX_RPS);

   return locust;
 }

 public static void main(String[] args) {
   new RouteGuideLoadGen().getFeatureLoad();
 }
}
```

Let‚Äôs unpack this

We have a method to configure our slave worker with the locust master instance

We then invoke the run method and provide it a task instance

```java
public void getFeatureLoad() {
   var locust = configureLocustMaster();

   locust.run(new GetFeatureTask(1));
 }
```

We also use the below method to get a Locust instance and set the master host, port as well as the peak requests per second (RPS) for the slave.

```java
private Locust configureLocustMaster() {
   var locust = Locust.getInstance();

   locust.setMasterHost(LOCUST_MASTER_HOST);
   locust.setMasterPort(LOCUST_MASTER_PORT);
   locust.setMaxRPS(LOCUST_MAX_RPS);

   return locust;
 }
```

## Locust load task

We also have to write a Locust task that has the actual gRPC API that we want to invoke.

```java
public class GetFeatureTask extends AbstractTask {
 private final int weight;

 RouteGuideTestClient client =
     new RouteGuideTestClient(ROUTE_GUIDE_SERVER_HOST, ROUTE_GUIDE_SERVER_PORT);

 public GetFeatureTask(int weight) {
   this.weight = weight;
 }

 @Override
 public int getWeight() {
   return weight;
 }

 public String getName() {
   return "RouteGuide.GetFeature";
 }

 public void execute() {
   int latitude = 407838351;
   int longitude = -746143763;

   Point point = Point.newBuilder().setLatitude(latitude).setLongitude(longitude).build();

   // Record the startTime for the API call
   var startTime = getTime();
   // Add thread safe logic here to make the API call
   Feature response = client.getFeature(point);
   // Record the endTime for the API call
   var endTime = getTime();

   // Do not swallow any exceptions from the API, we should propagate any exceptions to locust
   assertWithMessage(
           "Could not find the feature at lat: %s long: %s".formatted(latitude, longitude))
       .that(response.getName())
       .isEqualTo("Patriots Path, Mendham, NJ 07945, USA");

   // Record success or failure to locust
   long responseTime = endTime - startTime;
   int contentLength = response.getName().length();

   Locust.getInstance()
       .recordSuccess("GetFeature", response.getName(), responseTime, contentLength);
 }
}
```

Above is the complete method, let‚Äôs understand how this works

We create a task **GetFeatureTask** that extends **AbstractTask** from locust4j

We configure the local Grpc client

```java
RouteGuideTestClient client =
     new RouteGuideTestClient(ROUTE_GUIDE_SERVER_HOST, ROUTE_GUIDE_SERVER_PORT);
```

And also configure a constructor and getter to set custom weight if we want from the caller

```java
public GetFeatureTask(int weight) {
   this.weight = weight;
 }

 @Override
 public int getWeight() {
   return weight;
 }
```

We set the name to be used during the load test

```java
public String getName() {
   return "RouteGuide.GetFeature";
 }
```

Finally the execute method has the actual logic wherein we invoke the locally running service

```java
public void execute() {
   int latitude = 407838351;
   int longitude = -746143763;

   Point point = Point.newBuilder().setLatitude(latitude).setLongitude(longitude).build();

   // Record the startTime for the API call
   var startTime = getTime();
   // Add thread safe logic here to make the API call
   Feature response = client.getFeature(point);
   // Record the endTime for the API call
   var endTime = getTime();

   // Do not swallow any exceptions from the API, we should propagate any exceptions to locust
   assertWithMessage(
           "Could not find the feature at lat: %s long: %s".formatted(latitude, longitude))
       .that(response.getName())
       .isEqualTo("Patriots Path, Mendham, NJ 07945, USA");

   // Record success or failure to locust
   long responseTime = endTime - startTime;
   int contentLength = response.getName().length();

   Locust.getInstance()
       .recordSuccess("GetFeature", response.getName(), responseTime, contentLength);
 }
```

An interesting thing to note is that we capture the total time taken for the API call and response to come back and then later on persist it in the Locust instance using below:

```java
Locust.getInstance()
       .recordSuccess("GetFeature", response.getName(), responseTime, contentLength);
```

## Start the load test

We can run [RouteGuideLoadGen.java](https://github.com/automationhacks/grasp-grpc/blob/main/src/main/java/io/automationhacks/routeguide/perf/RouteGuideLoadGen.java) to start the slave and register it with the master.

If we navigate to the locust master host running at [http://0.0.0.0:8089](http://0.0.0.0:8089), we can see below UI

Here we‚Äôll be kind and just use 5 users with a ramp up of 1 user per second.

![Locust home page](assets/images/2024/06/locust-home.png)

We can see the charts with real time performance RPS and failure stats and other diagnostic data.

![Locust charts](assets/images/2024/06/locust-charts.png)

The workers tab also shows the current no of workers registered

![Locust workers](assets/images/2024/06/locust-workers.png)

And we can also see stats about the overall test

![Locust stats](assets/images/2024/06/locust-stats.png)

Since this is a local test running on my machine, I also used the Activity monitor app and could see spike in CPU and memory usage stats while the test was running. Within a short time, I bombarded 40K RPS on my locally hosted service. Surely a pretty sizable scale for a single service. ü§©
