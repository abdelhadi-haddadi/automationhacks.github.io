Things are getting pretty exciting, in the previous part [Hello, espresso! Part
2 Working with
lists]({% link _posts/2022-05-07-hello-espresso-part-2-working-with-lists.md %}),
we learnt how to work with list controls (`RecyclerView`, `AdapterView`) in
espresso. Go ahead and have a read in case you missed it.

## Learning to test Intents

In this post, we'll understand how to automate testing of intents using
espresso.

`espresso-intents` provides us the capabilities to validate whether the correct
intent is invoked with valid data by our app or even stub out the intents sent
out so that we can verify only our apps logic (while assuming other app that we
depend upon has been tested independently)

## What is an intent?

In
[developer.android.com's post of Intent](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Intent)

> An intent is an abstract description of an operation to be performed.
>
> It can be used:
>
> - with `startActivity` to launch an Activity,
> - `broadcastIntent` to send it to any interested `BroadcastReceiver`
>   components,
> - and `Context.startService(Intent)` or
>   `Context.bindService(Intent, ServiceConnection, int)` to communicate with a
>   background Service.

One of the use cases for which **Intents** are used a lot is to **launch
Activities** and they can be thought is a data structure that holds an abstract
description of an action to be performed

There are 2 components to an Intent:

- **Action:** What action has to be performed, for example:
  - [`ACTION_VIEW`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Intent#ACTION_VIEW)
    displays data to the user, for instance, if we use it as `tel: URI` it will
    invoke the dialer (we'll see this in our example),
  - [`ACTION_EDIT`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Intent#ACTION_EDIT)
    gives explicit edit access to given data
- **Data:** Data to operate on expressed as a
  [`Uri`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/net/Uri)

You can read the full doc
[here](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Intent) to
understand Intents in depth

## Understand App under test

Let's start by understanding the app under test

We'll use
[`IntentsBasicSample`](https://github.com/automationhacks/testing-samples/tree/main/ui/espresso/IntentsBasicSample)
app, which has an `EditText` to enter a phone no and a `Button` to either call a
number or to randomly pick a no.

The below scenarios are possible

> I've written this in Gherkin syntax for clarity, however in a live test, the
> tests should always describe behavior and no be as procedural as i've written
> below. Read [this](https://cucumber.io/docs/bdd/better-gherkin/) page on
> cucumber website to understand more

Let's use Layout inspector to grab the selectors for the elements we want to
work with:

![Layout inspector](../assets/images/2022/05/intents-layout-inspector.png)

```text
GIVEN user is on home screen
WHEN user taps on enter phone no EditText with id: @id/edit_text_caller_number
AND user types a valid phone no
AND user taps on call number Button with id: id	@id/button_call_number
THEN the dialer activity is shown with entered phone no
```

![Intents basic sample home](../assets/images/2022/05/intents-home-with-no.png)

![After user tapped on call number](../assets/images/2022/05/intents-dialer.png)

## Add required dependencies

We need to add `espresso-intents` dependency to our `app/build.gradle` file as
below, also its only compatible with espresso `2.1+` and android testing lib
version `0.3+`, so we double check these versions

```java
androidTestImplementation 'androidx.test.espresso:espresso-intents:3.4.0'
androidTestImplementation 'androidx.test:runner :1.4.0'
androidTestImplementation 'androidx.test:rules:1.4.0'
androidTestImplementation 'androidx.test.espresso:espresso-core:3.4.0'
```

## Test to launch a dialer activity using intents and validation

Below is the complete test to perform our scenario, don't worry if it does not
make sense right now, we'll unpack this in detail below, the sample is mentioned
for completeness

```java
@RunWith(AndroidJUnit4.class)
@LargeTest
public class DialerActivityPracticeTest {
  public static final String VALID_PHONE_NUMBER = "123-456-7898";

  @Rule
  public GrantPermissionRule grantPermissionRule =
      GrantPermissionRule.grant("android.permission.CALL_PHONE");

  @Rule
  public IntentsTestRule<DialerActivity> testRule = new IntentsTestRule<>(DialerActivity.class);

  /** Test to enter a phone number and make a call and verify an intent is launched */
  @Test
  public void whenTapOnCallNumber_ThenOutgoingCallIsMade() {
    // Type a phone no and close keyboard
    Uri phoneNumber = Uri.parse("tel:" + VALID_PHONE_NUMBER);
    onView(withId(R.id.edit_text_caller_number)).perform(typeText(VALID_PHONE_NUMBER), closeSoftKeyboard());

    // Tap on call number button
    onView(withId(R.id.button_call_number)).perform(click());

    // Verify an intent is called with action and phone no and package
    intended(allOf(hasAction(Intent.ACTION_CALL), hasData(phoneNumber)));
  }
}
```

### Setting up intents and permissions

- Just like `Views`, we'll use JUnit rules to setup and teardown our intents
  before and after each test. We use `IntentsTestRule` for this instead of
  `ActivityTestRule`.
- Since we want to automate the `DialerActivity` class, we'll pass that as the
  type

```java
@Rule
public IntentsTestRule<DialerActivity> testRule = new IntentsTestRule<>(DialerActivity.class);
```

- We also want our test to have permissions to make a call and thus add below
  snippet as another JUnit rule to ensure we don't get any permission errors

```java
@Rule
public GrantPermissionRule grantPermissionRule = GrantPermissionRule.grant("android.permission.CALL_PHONE");
```

### Writing core test logic

With that taken care of lets write our test

We store a test number in a static variable

```java
public static final String VALID_PHONE_NUMBER = "123-456-7898";
```

We'll type the phone no into our EditText as below and then close the keyboard:

```java
onView(withId(R.id.edit_text_caller_number)).perform(typeText(VALID_PHONE_NUMBER), closeSoftKeyboard());
```

We'll then tap the call number button

```java
// Tap on call number button
onView(withId(R.id.button_call_number)).perform(click());
```

### Asserting our intent was fired

Great, we want to verify that our Intent was actually invoked and we can achieve
that using `intended` method that takes an Intent matcher (either an existing
one or our own).

> You can refer to
> [Hamcrest Tutorial](https://code.google.com/archive/p/hamcrest/wikis/Tutorial.wiki)
> understand how hamcrest matchers work since we are going to use them heavily

```java
// Verify an intent is called with action and phone no and package
intended(allOf(hasAction(Intent.ACTION_CALL), hasData(phoneNumber)));
```

If you notice, we use `allOf()` matcher, that checks that the examined object
matches **all of the specified matchers**

We first check that the `intent` had the correct action by calling
`hasAction(Intent.ACTION_CALL)`

How do we know which action to assert? ðŸ¤”

We can look into app source in
[`DialerActivity`](https://github.com/automationhacks/testing-samples/blob/main/ui/espresso/IntentsBasicSample/app/src/main/java/com/example/android/testing/espresso/IntentsBasicSample/DialerActivity.java)
to understand more details about our intent

If you look at `createCallIntentFromNumber` method, you can see we create an
intent with action `Intent.ACTION_CALL`:

```java
intentToCall.setData(Uri.parse("tel:" + number));
```

Also we see that we set a phone no as the intents data in:

```java
intentToCall.setData(Uri.parse("tel:" + number));
```

Here is the full method for reference

```java
private Intent createCallIntentFromNumber() {
  final Intent intentToCall = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_CALL);
  String number = mCallerNumber.getText().toString();
  intentToCall.setData(Uri.parse("tel:" + number));
  return intentToCall;
}
```

Thus we also assert that our intent has the correct phone no set as data by:

Preparing the phone no `Uri` earlier

```java
Uri phoneNumber = Uri.parse("tel:" + VALID_PHONE_NUMBER);
```

and then adding below line in our `allOf` matcher

```java
hasData(phoneNumber)
```

If you run this test, you'll see the Dialer Activity pop up and if you care
about this activity then you could write some assertions on top of it.

## Test only our intent without making an external activity call a.k.a Stubbing

In the previous test, we saw how intents launching another activity can be
easily validated using `intended`,

However, In if we care about testing only our apps logic and no so much of a 3rd
party apps logic (since we cannot manipulate the UI of an external activity, nor
control the `ActivityResult` returned to the activity we are testing), then
espresso allows us to stub intents and return a mock response as well using
`intending`

Let's see how we can do this:

Below is now our updated functional test flow

```text
GIVEN user is on home screen
WHEN user taps on pick number Button with id: @id/button_pick_contact
AND user taps on call number Button with id: @id/button_call_number
THEN intent call to dialer activity is stubbed
AND we check that an intent call was made
```

We write the below test to achieve this:

```java
@RunWith(AndroidJUnit4.class)
@LargeTest
public class DialerActivityPracticeTest {
  public static final String VALID_PHONE_NUMBER = "123-456-7898";

  @Rule
  public GrantPermissionRule grantPermissionRule =
      GrantPermissionRule.grant("android.permission.CALL_PHONE");

  @Rule
  public IntentsTestRule<DialerActivity> testRule = new IntentsTestRule<>(DialerActivity.class);

  /** Espresso does not stub any intents, with below method all external intents would be stubbed */
  @Before
  public void stubAllExternalIntents() {
    intending(not(isInternal()))
        .respondWith(new Instrumentation.ActivityResult(Activity.RESULT_OK, null));
  }

  @Test
  public void whenPickNumber_AndTapOnCallWithStub_ThenStubbedResponseIsReturned() {
    // To stub all intents to contacts activity to return a valid phone number
    // we use intending() and verify if component has class name ContactsActivity
    // then we responding with valid result
    intending(hasComponent(hasShortClassName(".ContactsActivity")))
        .respondWith(
            new Instrumentation.ActivityResult(
                Activity.RESULT_OK, ContactsActivity.createResultData(VALID_PHONE_NUMBER)));

    onView(withId(R.id.button_pick_contact)).perform(click());
    onView(withId(R.id.edit_text_caller_number)).check(matches(withText(VALID_PHONE_NUMBER)));
  }
}
```

Let's understand how this is achieved in our test, we add a method with below
implementation:

```java
/** Espresso does not stub any intents, with below method all external intents would be stubbed */
  @Before
  public void stubAllExternalIntents() {
    intending(not(isInternal()))
        .respondWith(new Instrumentation.ActivityResult(Activity.RESULT_OK, null));
  }
```

Let's walk through how this works:

- We add a method `stubAllExternalIntents` and annotate it with `@Before` such
  that it runs before any test method
- We can configure espresso to return a `RESULT_OK` for any intent call by using
  `isInternal()` which is an intent matcher that checks **if an intents package
  is the same as the target package for the instrumentation test.**
  - since in this case we want to stub out all intent calls to other activities
    we can wrap this with a `not()`
