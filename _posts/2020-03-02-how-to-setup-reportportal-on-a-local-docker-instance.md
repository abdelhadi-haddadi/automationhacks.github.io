ReportPortal is one of the new reporting solutions available. It supports multiple different test
frameworks like TestNG, Cucumber, Pytest and many more.

This post is the first in a series of posts on how to set up ReportPortal effectively and leverage
the best use out of it.

Let's get started.

## Setup with Docker

I have created a sample project on Github which would have all the examples from this project. You
can find it
<a href="https://github.com/gaurav-singh/grasp-reporting" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>
and would also have the code snippets in GitHub gists.

The instructions that I am describing here can also be found on [ReportPortal docs for mac](https://reportportal.io/docs/installation-steps/DeployWithDockerOnLinuxMac/) or [windows](https://reportportal.io/docs/installation-steps/DeployWithDockerOnWindows/)

- As a pre-requisite, you should
  <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/getting-started-with-gradle.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">set
  up an empty Java/kotlin project with Gradle</a>. The easiest way to set this up is with the use of
  IntelliJ wizard, however, feel free to use the method of your choice
- ReportPortal uses services like **PostgresSQL, RabbitMQ, and Traefik** behind the wraps and while
  there is an option to
  <a href="https://github.com/reportportal/shell-installation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">set
  these up individually without docker</a>, the quickest and simplest way to start using **Report
  portal is to use Docker**
- Make sure you have a **docker engine and
  <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">docker-compose</a>**
  already installed. If you are on Mac, Using Docker for mac would make the quickest sense however
  Docker is available on the platform of your choice (Windows, Linux) and docker docs are a good
  resource to set these up
- Download latest docker-compose.yml from
  <a href="https://github.com/reportportal/reportportal/blob/master/docker-compose.yml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here,</a>
  a quicker way to download this is to use below command

<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reportportal/reportportal/master/docker-compose.yml -o docker-compose.yml</pre>

- Once downloaded, execute below command to pull the required images and start containers

<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">docker-compose -p reportportal up -d --force-recreate</pre>

ReportPortal recommends you use allocate at least 3 GB of ram and this could be set up via the
Docker desktop console. There are a bunch of other configurations we can make but let's go with a
minimal setup first

We would revisit these in a future post.

## Verify login

With the above steps, ReportPortal containers are already spun up.

To verify, it is running fine. You can navigate to

```text
http://localhost:8080/ui/#login
```

you should be able to see the login screen.

![ReportPortal login](/assets/images/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/report_portal_login.png)

You can log in with the default user or admin passwords below:

<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">default\1q2w3e
or
superadmin\erebus</pre>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
  <p>
    Please remember to change these as soon as you login for security sake
  </p>
</blockquote>

## Create a blank project

After logging in as admin, Let's create a blank project for our test setup

Go to the top-right icon, select Administrate and then create a new project. I have created a dummy
project by the name of **test_project**

Once created, select the project from the drop-down list and then again click on the login
information section and select Profile.

![Select project in ReportPortal](/assets/images/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/rp_project_selection.png)

Make a note of the **information in the Profile section**, we are going to need it later on

## Setting up Gradle, dependencies, and listener

ReportPortal can easily be set up with any build tool of your choice.

In this example, we are going to use Gradle and then set up the required dependencies and the report
portal listener which would be able to capture the test execution events and send them in real-time
to our dashboard

Below is the basic configuration to set up the required agent and listener via gradle

{% gist 4c58cb3c7054af57f4c52400368bfc3d %}

## Explanation:

- Ln 10 &#8211; 13 sets up the maven repository for ReportPortal on the bintray site
- Ln 15 &#8211; 21 sets up an overridden task of type `Test` with logic to print all output on the
  console (Ln 17), disable the use of default listeners (Ln 18) and registers the ReportPortal
  TestNG listener (Ln 19)
- Ln 25 Set up a basic TestNG agent
- Ln 26 Setup the latest version of TestNG

## Setup properties file

Create a file named `reportportal.properties` under `test/resources` and paste the earlier copied
content from the **profile** section of your created project

## A simple test

I have a verify basic TestNG test setup in the test folder which should always fail (for demo
purposes)

![Calculator test](assets/images/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/calc_test.png)

## Let's run

Now, let's run the suite. Execute below command:

<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">./gradlew clean runTests</pre>

Once the suite executes, we can observe the failure in the ReportPortal as a launch

### Launches:

Every unique test run is called a launch in the ReportPortal.

We can now select the launch to see an overview of the run. We can also see that our suite failed as
expected.

![Launches](/assets/images/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/result_1-1.png)

We can select the failure to see more details and mark each test under different categories (Product
bug, automation bug, system issue). By default, every test is marked as **To investigate**

![](/assets/images/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/result_2.png)

Also, we can click on the test and see the full stack trace of the failure similar to the Gradle
report. However, as more tests are run, we are able to easily see a historical snapshot of the same
test and how it behaved in different launches.

## Conclusion

ReportPortal is an exciting new tool and gives you the ability to have a central dashboard for all
your different test runs regardless of the framework you have used to author it.
