I posted about [this topic](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/automationhacks_softwaretesting-qa-qualityengineering-activity-7244599705110749184-DkEm?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) on LinkedIn and saw a lot of engagement. Somehow I have this eerie feeling that I’ll be pointing people to this blog in the future as well 🔮

1. It's not **automation** testing, it’s **automated** testing - We are not testing automation, we are automating tests
2. It's not **QA** Automation, it's just **Test** automation or better **Automation In Testing (AIT)** - we cannot fully automate quality assurance, it is a broad term and some activities will require human intuition, we can automate tests to give faster feedback at scale.
3. It's not a **QA Automation engineer**, call them **SDET** or **Test** engineer please, and yes people with these titles both write automated tests but there are differences, read [this](https://automationhacks.io/2021/08/22/who-the-heck-is-an-SDET)
4. **QA Engineer** is not the same as **SDET**, again there is a difference 😉 - read blog in point 3 for more details
5. **Flaky** tests are not the same as **broken** tests, there is a difference 😉 - Broken tests are nice as they fail all the time, but flaky tests? not so much, sometimes they pass, sometimes they fail, but they always point to a nice problem underneath to debug, don’t ignore them, and don’t retry them 5 times.
6. **Assertions** and **checks** are mostly the same! I rest my case!
7. **Quality engineering** is loosely the same as **QA Engineering** as a term to refer to the organization - dropping **assurance** does not make much difference. Leadership does implicit conversion anyway and applies their old biases. Calling it Test engineering is more explicit
8. **QA is a process, it's not an engineer** - Would you refer a person with something abstract? Probably not. Calling them testers is much better and more explicit. 🙏
9. **100% automation**, really? - your energy is much better focussed on ROI (return on investment) driven automation. The [Pareto principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle) exists for a reason. Chasing vanity metrics just leads to unnecessary suboptimal waste

Your mileage may vary. We can refer to the same thing with different labels and that's completely okay

Did I just stir up a hornet's nest? 🫣 \
I've learned to not care about these much but occasionally push some buttons and I prefer some over the other. I thought I'd just put it out there.
