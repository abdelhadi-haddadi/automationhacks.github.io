GIT is one of the most popular SCM tools being used these days, and even though there are lot of UI interfaces to it (Source tree, GIT extensions etc), It really helps to know about the beautiful command line behind those actions.

The challenge is how to remember them all when you need it right?, Iâ€™ve found mind maps to be really useful in this regard and hence created one for GIT commands using mindmeister tool.

Have a look and let me know if this helps you!
