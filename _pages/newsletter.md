## What is this newsletter about? 📚

With this newsletter, I’ll be going deep into:

- How Software Testing and Test automation work from a **technology
  perspective** with **deep posts** about **frameworks, tooling, and internals**
  across different stacks (with my practical experience mixed in 😉)
- How **leadership** teams at **Startups** and **Big Tech** cultivate and
  **scale their Test engineering** organizations.
- This thing we all refer to as **“Quality”** 🙌🏼

Would you be interested in reading more about this? Consider subscribing to not
miss out when a new post comes out!

Many engineers expense this newsletter from their L&D/education budgets

It’s gonna be a cool and interesting journey and I hope you’ll join me in this.
