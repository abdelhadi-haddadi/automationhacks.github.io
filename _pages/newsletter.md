## What is this newsletter about? 📚

With this newsletter, I’ll be going deep into:

- How Software Testing and Test automation work from a **technology
  perspective** with **deep posts** about **frameworks, tooling, and internals**
  across different stacks (with my practical experience mixed in 😉)
- How **leadership** teams at **Startups** and **Big Tech** cultivate and
  **scale their Test engineering** organizations (aka **"The human factors"**) 🫂.
- This thing we all refer to as **“Quality”** 🙌🏼 🖖

Would you be interested in reading more about this?

Consider **subscribing** to not miss out when a new post comes out!

It’s gonna be a cool and interesting journey and I hope you’ll join me in this. 🏃 🏃‍♀️
