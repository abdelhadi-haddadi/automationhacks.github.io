Hi there üëãüèª,

I'm Gaurav Singh. I live in Bangalore, India with my wife and with my other love ...

Computers what else? I am a self-proclaimed geek. My first PC was an **Intel 80386** running
**Windows 3.1** and the earliest programming language I remember working with was **BASIC**.

Over the years, I have been testing and **automating** a lot of Web apps, Mobile Apps (Android/IOS)
and Backend systems (API, Distributed systems) in different domains.

I consider myself a fairly experienced tester and have spent a significant amount of time writing
automation frameworks and utilities in Python, Java and Kotlin. I also dabble with a bit of
JavaScript occasionally

My work and experience have made me quite _opinionated_ on how _testing should happen_ and I do
**NOT** believe a tester is a sole person responsible for Quality but rather in a whole team testing
approach.

One of my core principles in life is to _Have strong opinions weakly held_ and thus healthy debate
and discussion are **very** valuable to me. That is how we all grow and learn IMHO.

I also consider myself to be a reasonable person overall and am always keen to listen and understand
all viewpoints for something under discussion before coming to my own conclusions.

## Why do you blog?

My reasons are mostly selfish. I needed a repository of solutions to common Test automation problems
and also a way to keep track of my journey through the world of Software Test engineering.

This blog is a way for me to hold on to all these experiences and sort of leave a trail of
breadcrumbs which I could go back and refer.

To me, testing is a **holistic** field in itself with its own set of **nuances** and this blog is a
way for me express and share it with the larger community.

Hopefully, this is useful, relevant or at least interesting to other people as well.
