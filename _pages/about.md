Hi there 👋🏻,

I'm Gaurav Singh. I live in Bangalore, India 🇮🇳 with my wife and with my other love ...

Computers 💻 what else?

I like to think of myself as a Technology enthusiast and geek. My first PC ran on a **Intel 80386
CPU with just 80 MB Storage and 1 MB RAM** 🤯 running
[**Windows 3.1**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_3.1x) and the earliest programming language
I remember fumbling with was [**BASIC**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC) so I guess I grew up
around computers right off the bat

Over the years, I have been **Testing** and **Automating** a lot of Web apps, Mobile Apps
(Android/IOS) and Backend systems (API, Distributed systems) in different domains and companies of
different sizes ranging from large enterprises, mid sized product companies and hyper growth
startups

I consider myself a fairly experienced **Tester** and have spent a significant amount of time
writing automation frameworks and utilities in Python, Java and Kotlin. I also dabble with a bit of
JavaScript occasionally

My work and experience have made me quite _opinionated_ on how _good testing should happen_ and I do
**NOT** believe a tester is a sole person responsible for Quality but rather in a whole team testing
approach.

## Core values and principles

One of my core principles in life is to **Have strong opinions weakly held** and thus healthy debate
and discussion are **very** valuable to me to learn and grow together. I believe best ideas should
stand on the shoulder of data and experience and in the end should win.

I also like to follow the [**reasonable person principle**](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~weigand/staff/)
and am always keen to listen and understand all viewpoints for something under discussion before
coming to my own conclusions.

I believe in
[**Trust, but verify**](https://www.forbes.com/sites/frankarmstrong/2019/10/21/trust-but-verify/?sh=43ec8e135873)
and like to give people a lot of upfront benefit of the doubt but believe over the long term trust
is largely **earned** through **actions and behavior** and I do not look at just the surface but try
to dive deeper.

I believe the **best way to learn something is to teach it** and thus I try to be active in the
Software engineering community and share as well as learn from others. You may find value in going
through some of the [courses](courses.md) i've created and [talks](talks.md) that i've delivered.

## Why do you blog?

My reasons are mostly selfish. I needed a repository of solutions to common Test automation problems
and also a way to keep track of my journey through the world of Software engineering.

This blog is a way for me to hold on to all these experiences and sort of leave a trail of
breadcrumbs which I (_or someone else_) could go back and refer.

To me, testing is a **holistic** field in itself with its own set of **nuances** and this blog is a
way for me express and share it with the larger community.

Hopefully, this is useful, relevant or at least interesting to other people as well.

## What does the logo mean?

Testing and Automation to me is often exploring a network of **Connected/overlapping**
**components/concerns** within a specific **context** and this symbol represents the same to me.
