I try to regularly share my knowledge with the **Test automation** community over at conferences.
Please find the list of past talks below

> Also, üßèüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Feedback is how we all learn, if you have some on these talks, do reach out!

**On Talk slides:** I have recently switched to using pure **markdown** and **Mkdocs static site
generator** for all conference slides.

You can view all of them on [https://automationhacks.io/slides/](https://automationhacks.io/slides/)
